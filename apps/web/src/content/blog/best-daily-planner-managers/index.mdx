Managing people is fundamentally different from individual contributor work. You spend your days switching between one-on-ones, team meetings, strategic planning, and putting out fires—often with less than 15 minutes between context switches. **The daily planner that worked when you were an IC is almost certainly failing you now.**

A McKinsey study found that executives spend an average of 23 hours per week in meetings. For middle managers, it's often higher. Add delegation tracking, performance management, and the strategic thinking your role demands, and you're left with fractured time that most productivity apps weren't designed to handle.

This is why finding the **best daily planner app for managers** requires different criteria than generic productivity roundups. You don't just need task management—you need meeting defense, delegation visibility, and protected time for the strategic work only you can do.

We've evaluated eight tools specifically through the lens of management challenges: meeting overload, delegation tracking, and the need for uninterrupted strategic thinking time. The results reveal that most popular planners fall short—and that one free option, **Open Sunsama**, delivers the manager-specific features you need without the $200+/year price tag.

## What Managers Actually Need From a Daily Planner

Before comparing tools, let's establish what makes **manager productivity tools** different from general task managers.

### Meeting Management (Not Just Scheduling)

Most productivity apps treat meetings as immutable calendar blocks. But managers need more:

- **Meeting preparation**: Time to review agendas and previous notes before joining
- **Buffer zones**: Protected gaps between back-to-back meetings for mental reset
- **Meeting defense**: Automatic protection of focus time from meeting requests
- **Post-meeting actions**: Easy capture of follow-ups and delegations

An **executive planner app** should make meetings work for you, not consume your entire day.

### Delegation Tracking

When you assign tasks to direct reports, you need visibility:

- What did I delegate and to whom?
- What's the status without micromanaging?
- What's at risk of slipping?
- What follow-ups do I owe my team?

Most task apps focus on what *you* need to do. Managers need to track what *others* are doing too.

### Strategic Time Protection

The Pareto principle hits hard in management: 20% of your decisions drive 80% of outcomes. But that strategic thinking requires uninterrupted time—exactly what your fragmented calendar won't give you. Understanding the [maker vs manager schedule](/blog/maker-vs-manager-schedule) is critical for protecting this time.

**Leadership time management** means deliberately protecting time for:

- Quarterly planning and goal setting
- Career development conversations
- Process improvement thinking
- Industry analysis and competitive research

Without protected strategic blocks, these high-leverage activities get squeezed out by urgent-but-less-important demands.

### Context Switching Management

Managers face a unique cognitive load: switching between people, projects, and strategic levels multiple times per hour. Your daily planner should help you:

- See your day holistically before it starts
- Batch similar activities together
- Identify and protect flow-state opportunities
- Track actual time allocation versus intended allocation

## Quick Comparison: Best Daily Planner Apps for Managers

Here's how eight popular tools stack up for management-specific needs:

| App | Price | Meeting Defense | Delegation | Strategic Blocks | Calendar Sync | Focus Mode |
|-----|-------|-----------------|------------|------------------|---------------|------------|
| **Open Sunsama** | Free | ⚠️ Manual | ✅ Via subtasks | ✅ Time blocking | ✅ Full 2-way | ✅ Built-in |
| **Sunsama** | $240/yr | ⚠️ Manual | ✅ Via subtasks | ✅ Time blocking | ✅ Full 2-way | ✅ Built-in |
| **Motion** | $228/yr | ✅ AI-powered | ❌ Limited | ✅ Auto-scheduled | ✅ Full 2-way | ⚠️ Basic |
| **Reclaim AI** | $96/yr+ | ✅ AI-powered | ❌ No | ✅ Smart blocks | ✅ Full 2-way | ⚠️ Basic |
| **Calendly** | $120/yr+ | ⚠️ Scheduling only | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Full 2-way | ❌ No |
| **Fellow** | $84/yr+ | ❌ No | ✅ Action items | ❌ No | ✅ Read only | ❌ No |
| **Todoist** | $48/yr | ❌ No | ✅ Projects/labels | ❌ No | ⚠️ 1-way | ❌ No |
| **Notion** | Free–$120/yr | ❌ No | ✅ Databases | ⚠️ Manual | ❌ No native | ❌ No |

**Legend**: ✅ Strong | ⚠️ Limited | ❌ Not available

The comparison reveals an important insight: no single tool does everything perfectly. But **Open Sunsama** offers the best value for managers who need time blocking, focus mode, and full calendar sync without paying $200+/year.

Let's examine each tool in detail.

## 1. Open Sunsama – Best Free Daily Planner for Budget-Conscious Managers

**Price: Completely free | Open source | Self-hostable**

Open Sunsama is the **best daily planner app for managers** who want professional-grade features without subscription costs. It delivers the core functionality that made Sunsama popular—time blocking, calendar sync, focus mode—at zero cost.

### Why It Works for Managers

**Calendar-centric planning**: Your meetings and tasks live on the same timeline. Each morning, you see exactly where your time is committed and where opportunities exist. Drag tasks into open slots to claim them before meetings do.

**Time blocking for strategic work**: Block 90-minute chunks for strategic thinking, and they appear on your calendar alongside meetings. If you use Google Calendar for team scheduling, these blocks show as busy—natural meeting defense.

**Focus mode for deep work**: When you finally get an uninterrupted hour, maximize it. Open Sunsama's [focus mode](/features/focus-mode) expands your current task to full screen, starts an optional timer, and removes distractions. For managers who struggle to find focus time, making that time count matters.

**Subtask delegation tracking**: While not a full delegation system, you can use subtasks to track what you're waiting on from others. Create a task "Q2 Marketing Plan" with subtasks for each team member's contribution, checking them off as deliverables arrive.

### The Open Source Advantage for Enterprises

For managers in larger organizations, Open Sunsama's open-source nature offers unique benefits:

- **Self-hosting option**: Run it on company infrastructure for data sovereignty
- **Security transparency**: Your IT team can audit the code
- **No vendor lock-in**: Your productivity system isn't dependent on a startup's survival
- **Customization potential**: Technical teams can extend functionality

### What's Missing

Open Sunsama doesn't have AI-powered meeting defense like Motion or Reclaim. You'll need to manually block strategic time. It also lacks dedicated delegation workflows—you're working within a personal productivity tool, not a team management system.

### Best For

Managers who want Sunsama-level daily planning without the $240/year cost. Particularly valuable for:

- Middle managers with tight training/tool budgets
- Startup leaders watching every dollar
- Privacy-conscious executives who want transparent, self-hostable software
- Technical leaders who appreciate open source

## 2. Sunsama – Premium Daily Planning With Polish

**Price: $240/year ($20/month)**

Sunsama pioneered the intentional daily planning category. It's a beautifully designed tool that guides managers through a structured planning ritual each day.

### What It Does Well

**Guided daily planning**: Each morning, Sunsama walks you through reviewing yesterday, choosing today's tasks, and estimating time. This ritual prevents the "everything is urgent" trap managers fall into.

**Integration depth**: Pull tasks from Asana, Trello, Linear, Notion, and more. For managers overseeing multiple projects in different tools, this aggregation is valuable.

**Time tracking built in**: See where your time actually goes versus where you planned. Over time, patterns emerge—maybe you're spending 40% of your week in meetings when you thought it was 25%.

**Team visibility** (Business plan): See your team's plans alongside yours. Useful for coordination without micromanagement.

### Where It Falls Short for Managers

The $240/year price is hard to justify when Open Sunsama offers similar core features for free. The integrations are valuable if you're pulling from multiple project management tools, but many managers work primarily from their calendar and email—not Asana or Trello.

### Best For

Managers at companies that expense productivity tools, who need deep integrations with Asana/Trello/Linear, and who value guided planning rituals over feature flexibility.

## 3. Motion – AI Scheduling for Meeting-Heavy Managers

**Price: $228/year ($19/month)**

Motion uses AI to automatically schedule your tasks around meetings. For managers drowning in calendar chaos, this hands-off approach is appealing.

### What It Does Well

**Automatic scheduling**: Add a task with a deadline and time estimate, and Motion finds a slot. Your calendar updates continuously as meetings shift. No manual drag-and-drop required.

**Meeting defense**: Motion can protect "focus time" blocks by automatically declining or suggesting alternatives for meeting requests during those periods.

**Project timeline visualization**: See how tasks cascade toward deadlines. Useful for managers tracking multiple project deliverables.

### Where It Falls Short

**Lack of control**: Some managers dislike AI moving their tasks without permission. The "I'll decide when to work on this" preference doesn't fit Motion's model.

**Limited delegation**: Motion is primarily a personal productivity tool. Team features exist but aren't its strength.

**Expensive for the category**: At $228/year, you're paying premium pricing for AI scheduling that some find more frustrating than helpful.

### Best For

Managers who trust algorithmic scheduling, have highly variable calendars, and want to "set and forget" their task planning. Not ideal for those who want manual control over their day.

## 4. Reclaim AI – Meeting Defense Specialist

**Price: Free tier available | Starter: $96/year | Business: $180/year**

Reclaim focuses specifically on protecting your calendar from meeting overload. It automatically defends focus time, lunch breaks, and personal habits.

### What It Does Well

**Smart time blocking**: Tell Reclaim you need 2 hours of focus time daily, and it finds and protects those windows. As meetings shift, your focus blocks move too.

**Habit scheduling**: Regular activities—weekly planning, exercise, lunch—get automatically scheduled and defended.

**Team scheduling**: Find meeting times that work across team calendars without the back-and-forth.

**Buffer automation**: Automatically add travel time or decompression gaps between meetings.

### Where It Falls Short for Managers

**Not a full daily planner**: Reclaim manages calendar blocks but doesn't have robust task management. You'll need a separate tool for tracking what to do during those focus blocks.

**Limited delegation tracking**: No built-in way to track work you've assigned to others.

**Free tier limitations**: The free version limits you to 3 habits and basic scheduling. Most managers will need paid tiers.

### Best For

Managers who already have task management figured out but can't protect time on their calendars. Use Reclaim for time defense, another tool (like Open Sunsama) for task execution.

## 5. Calendly – Scheduling, Not Planning

**Price: Free tier | Standard: $120/year | Teams: $192/year**

Calendly dominates meeting scheduling—letting others book time on your calendar based on your availability. But it's not a daily planner.

### What It Does Well

**Frictionless scheduling**: Share a link, people pick times, meetings get booked. Eliminates back-and-forth emails for external meetings.

**Availability rules**: Set buffer times, daily limits, and specific hours for different meeting types.

**Integrations**: Works with Zoom, Teams, Salesforce, and most calendars.

### Where It Falls Short

Calendly solves one problem: scheduling meetings with external parties. It doesn't help with:

- Task management
- Time blocking
- Delegation tracking
- Strategic planning
- Daily planning rituals

### Best For

Managers with heavy external meeting loads (sales, partnerships, recruiting) who need scheduling automation. Pair it with an actual daily planner like Open Sunsama for comprehensive productivity.

## 6. Fellow – Meeting Management Platform

**Price: Free tier | Pro: $84/year | Business: Custom**

Fellow focuses exclusively on meetings: agendas, notes, and action items. For managers who live in meetings, it's a specialized tool.

### What It Does Well

**Collaborative agendas**: Team members add topics before meetings. No more "what should we cover?" scrambling.

**Action item tracking**: Decisions and to-dos captured in meetings become tracked items with owners and due dates.

**1-on-1 management**: Templates and history for recurring one-on-ones with direct reports.

**Feedback integration**: Request and capture feedback tied to meeting contexts.

### Where It Falls Short

Fellow is a meeting tool, not a daily planner:

- No time blocking or calendar management
- No task management beyond meeting-derived action items
- No focus mode or strategic planning support
- Calendar integration is read-only

### Best For

Managers who need better meeting hygiene but already have daily planning solved. Use Fellow for meeting excellence, Open Sunsama for day-to-day planning.

## 7. Todoist – Task Management With Delegation Features

**Price: Free tier | Pro: $48/year | Business: $72/year**

Todoist is one of the most popular task managers worldwide. Its project and label system can support delegation tracking, though it's not designed specifically for managers.

### What It Does Well

**Clean task capture**: Quick entry across devices. Excellent for capturing commitments during meetings.

**Project organization**: Create projects for each direct report, initiative, or workstream.

**Labels for status**: Use labels like "waiting-on" or "delegated" to track ownership.

**Comments and attachments**: Add context to tasks for delegation clarity.

### Where It Falls Short for Managers

**No calendar view (free)**: The calendar view is premium-only, and even then, it shows due dates—not time blocks.

**No time blocking**: You can't schedule when you'll work on tasks. It's a list, not a plan.

**Limited calendar sync**: One-way sync only in most cases.

**Project limits (free)**: The 5-project limit is quickly exceeded by any manager.

### Best For

Managers who primarily need task capture and delegation tracking, don't need time blocking, and have calendar management solved elsewhere.

## 8. Notion – Flexible But Requires Building

**Price: Free for personal | Plus: $120/year | Business: Custom**

Notion can do almost anything—including serving as a **manager productivity tool**—but you'll need to build the system yourself.

### What It Does Well

**Custom databases**: Track tasks, delegations, 1-on-1 notes, and team goals in interconnected databases.

**Documentation home**: Meeting notes, project briefs, and team wikis in one place.

**Template flexibility**: Build exactly the management dashboard you want.

**Free for personal use**: Unlimited pages and blocks for individual accounts.

### Where It Falls Short for Managers

**No native calendar sync**: Your Notion tasks don't appear on your Google Calendar without third-party tools.

**No time blocking**: No timeline view for scheduling work to specific hours.

**Setup investment**: Building an effective management system takes significant upfront time.

**Complexity risk**: Notion's flexibility means it can become overwhelming without discipline.

### Best For

Managers who enjoy building systems, need a documentation hub, and don't require calendar-based time blocking. Not ideal for those wanting a ready-to-use daily planner.

## The Manager's Daily Planning Routine

Regardless of which tool you choose, effective **leadership time management** requires a consistent routine. Here's a framework that works:

### Morning Planning (10-15 minutes)

1. **Review calendar**: What meetings do you have? What preparation do they need?
2. **Check delegation status**: Any updates from direct reports? Blockers to address?
3. **Choose 3 priorities**: What are the three most important things to accomplish today—if nothing else gets done?
4. **Time block priorities**: When will you work on those three things? Put them on your calendar.
5. **Identify meeting prep**: Block 10-15 minutes before important meetings for preparation.

### Midday Reset (5 minutes)

1. **Check progress**: Are you on track for your three priorities?
2. **Adjust blocks**: Move afternoon plans if morning ran long.
3. **Clear quick wins**: Any small tasks that would create mental relief?

### End of Day Review (5-10 minutes)

1. **Capture incomplete work**: What needs to roll forward to tomorrow?
2. **Update delegations**: Any new assignments from today's meetings?
3. **Tomorrow preview**: What does tomorrow's calendar look like? Any preparation needed tonight?

This routine works in any tool, but Open Sunsama's calendar-centric design makes it particularly natural.

## Protecting Strategic Thinking Time

The hardest part of management isn't the meetings—it's finding time between them for the work that actually matters. Here's how to protect strategic thinking time:

### Block It First

Before your calendar fills up, block recurring strategic time:

- **Monday morning**: 90 minutes for weekly planning
- **Wednesday afternoon**: 2 hours for project review and course correction
- **Friday**: 1 hour for reflection and next-week preparation

Mark these as busy on your calendar. In Open Sunsama, create recurring time blocks that sync to your calendar.

### Defend It Actively

When meeting requests target your strategic blocks:

- Propose alternative times
- Decline with explanation: "I protect this time for strategic planning—can we find another slot?"
- Delegate attendance where appropriate

### Make It Visible

Let your team know when you're unavailable for interruptions:

- Use status indicators ("In focus mode until 3pm")
- Share your calendar so they see protected time
- Model the behavior you want them to adopt

### Batch Similar Strategic Work

Group related strategic activities:

- All 1-on-1 prep on Monday morning
- All performance review work on one afternoon
- All quarterly planning in one extended block

Batching reduces context-switching overhead and creates deeper thinking.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the best daily planner app for managers?

Open Sunsama is the best daily planner app for managers who want calendar sync, time blocking, and focus mode without expensive subscriptions. For managers needing AI-powered meeting defense, Motion or Reclaim AI are strong options at $96-228/year. The right choice depends on whether you prefer manual control (Open Sunsama) or algorithmic scheduling (Motion).

### How do managers protect time for strategic thinking?

Block strategic time on your calendar before it fills with meetings, mark blocks as busy so scheduling tools respect them, and actively decline or reschedule meeting requests that conflict. Tools like Open Sunsama and Reclaim AI help by making time blocks visible across your calendar.

### What features should managers look for in a daily planner?

Managers need: full two-way calendar sync, time blocking for scheduling tasks to specific hours, meeting buffer management, delegation or task tracking, and focus mode for protecting deep work. Avoid apps that only show task lists without calendar integration.

### Is Sunsama worth $240/year for managers?

Sunsama offers excellent daily planning with deep integrations, but Open Sunsama provides similar core features—calendar sync, time blocking, focus mode—completely free. Sunsama is worth considering if you need specific integrations (Asana, Linear, Trello) or guided planning rituals. Otherwise, the free alternative delivers comparable value.

### How do managers track delegated tasks?

Options include: using subtasks in Open Sunsama or Sunsama to track work waiting from team members, creating dedicated projects in Todoist with labels like "waiting-on," building delegation databases in Notion, or using meeting tools like Fellow to capture and track action items. The best approach depends on your team's communication patterns.

### What's the best free planner app for executives?

Open Sunsama is the best free daily planner for executives, offering calendar sync, time blocking, and focus mode without cost. Microsoft To Do is another free option but lacks time blocking. Most "free" executive planners are freemium with significant limitations.

### How do managers handle meeting overload?

Use tools with meeting defense features (Motion, Reclaim AI), block focus time before your calendar fills, set meeting-free days or half-days, delegate attendance where appropriate, and batch similar meetings together. The key is proactive calendar management rather than reactive acceptance of all requests.

### Can managers use personal productivity apps effectively?

Yes, with adaptations. Use subtasks or labels to track delegations, time block for strategic work, and integrate with your team's calendar. Open Sunsama works well for managers because its calendar-centric design matches how management work actually happens—scheduled around meetings.

### What's the difference between task management and daily planning?

Task management captures and organizes what needs to be done. Daily planning schedules when you'll do it. Most managers need both: a system for tracking all commitments (including delegations) and a calendar-based plan for each day's execution. Open Sunsama combines both in one interface. (For product managers specifically, see [best task management apps for product managers](/blog/best-task-management-product-managers).)

### How much should managers spend on productivity tools?

For most managers, $0-100/year is sufficient. Open Sunsama offers professional-grade features free. Paid options like Reclaim ($96/year) add AI scheduling. Premium tools like Sunsama ($240/year) or Motion ($228/year) are worthwhile only if specific features justify the cost—don't pay for complexity you won't use.

## Conclusion: The Right Tool for Management Realities

Finding the **best daily planner app for managers** means acknowledging that management is different from individual contributor work. You need meeting defense, delegation visibility, and protected strategic time—not just a prettier task list.

After evaluating eight popular options, here's the verdict:

- **Open Sunsama** offers the best value: professional daily planning features at zero cost, ideal for budget-conscious managers who want manual control over their day.
- **Motion** and **Reclaim AI** excel at AI-powered meeting defense, worth the $96-228/year for managers drowning in calendar chaos.
- **Sunsama** provides polished daily planning with deep integrations, justified at $240/year only if you need those specific integrations.
- **Fellow** and **Todoist** solve specific problems (meetings and task capture) but aren't complete daily planners.

For most managers, **Open Sunsama** is the starting point. It delivers the essential features—calendar sync, time blocking, focus mode—that make daily planning work for management realities. No artificial limitations, no premium upsells, no subscription fatigue.

Your time as a manager is your most constrained resource. Stop fighting with tools designed for individual contributors. Start planning your days intentionally with [time blocking features](/features/time-blocking) that respect how managers actually work.
