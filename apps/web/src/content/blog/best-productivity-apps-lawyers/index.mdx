Legal practice is one of the most demanding professions for personal productivity. Between billable hour requirements, court deadlines that cannot slip, client confidentiality obligations, and the constant context-switching between cases—attorneys face productivity challenges that generic task management apps simply don't address.

**The average lawyer bills 1,800-2,000 hours annually, but research shows attorneys work closer to 2,400 hours to achieve those billable targets.** That's 600+ hours of administrative overhead, time tracking, and task management that doesn't generate revenue but consumes precious working hours. The right productivity system recovers some of those hours while ensuring nothing falls through the cracks on active matters.

The best productivity app for lawyers doesn't just hold your task list. It tracks time seamlessly for accurate billing, alerts you to approaching deadlines before they become emergencies, keeps client matters confidential and separated, and helps you focus on billable work during available time. Most importantly, it fits into legal workflow rather than requiring you to adapt your practice to a consumer-focused tool.

In this guide, we'll compare the **best productivity apps for lawyers in 2026**, examining what makes each tool valuable for legal professionals and helping you build a system that handles the unique demands of legal practice.

## Why Lawyers Need Specialized Productivity Tools

Consumer productivity apps assume consistent schedules and single-focus work. Legal practice doesn't work that way.

### The Billable Hour Reality

For most attorneys, time is literally the product being sold. Billable hours must be tracked accurately, often in six-minute increments, and the pressure to hit targets is relentless. Yet tracking time interrupts the very work you're tracking, creating a constant friction between productivity and documentation.

**What lawyers need:** Automatic or low-friction time tracking integrated with task management, so capturing billable hours doesn't require context-switching to a separate system or remembering to start and stop timers.

### Deadline Management with Consequences

Legal deadlines aren't suggestions. Missing a statute of limitations destroys a case. Missing a court filing deadline means sanctions, malpractice exposure, or worse. Unlike business deadlines that can be renegotiated, legal deadlines are often immovable and unforgiving.

**What lawyers need:** Robust deadline tracking with multiple reminder alerts, clear visibility into upcoming due dates across all matters, and automatic calculation of response deadlines based on triggering events.

### Case-by-Case Confidentiality

Attorneys often represent clients with competing interests or handle matters requiring strict confidentiality walls. Work product on one case must remain invisible when discussing another matter—including during screen shares with clients or in open court.

**What lawyers need:** Clear matter separation that keeps each case's tasks, notes, and deadlines isolated, with easy filtering to show only one matter at a time.

### Deep Work Amid Constant Interruption

Legal work requires intense concentration—drafting briefs, analyzing contracts, preparing depositions. But attorneys are constantly interrupted by calls, emails, urgent client requests, and partners walking into offices. Protecting [deep work](/blog/deep-work-cal-newport-guide) time is essential but challenging.

**What lawyers need:** [Focus modes](/features/focus-mode) that eliminate distractions during deep work, [time blocking](/blog/what-is-time-blocking) that protects drafting sessions, and quick capture for urgent items without derailing current work.

### Multi-Matter Context Switching

Most attorneys juggle 20-50 active matters simultaneously. Each case has its own deadlines, parties, facts, and status. Switching from contract review on a real estate deal to motion practice on a personal injury case requires complete mental resets throughout the day.

**What lawyers need:** Matter-based organization that enables clean context switches, with quick access to a matter's full task list, deadlines, and notes when shifting focus.

### Security and Compliance

Attorney-client privilege and professional responsibility rules require protecting client information. Cloud-based tools must meet security standards. Some firms prohibit storing client data on third-party servers.

**What lawyers need:** Enterprise-grade security, compliance certifications, and ideally self-hosting options for firms with strict data residency requirements.

## What to Look for in Legal Productivity Tools

Based on how attorneys actually work, the ideal productivity system includes:

### 1. Matter/Case Organization

Clear organizational structure that keeps each client matter's tasks, deadlines, and notes separated. Ability to filter views to single matters when needed. Quick-switch between matters without losing context.

### 2. Time Tracking Integration

Built-in or seamlessly integrated time tracking that captures billable hours without friction. Ideally automatic tracking tied to focused work sessions or task completion. Export capability for billing systems.

### 3. Deadline Alerting

Multiple reminder levels for approaching deadlines. Calendar integration showing deadlines alongside other commitments. Clear visual hierarchy distinguishing urgent deadlines from routine tasks.

### 4. Calendar-Centric Planning

Calendar view that shows court dates, client meetings, and deadlines alongside tasks. Time blocking capability for scheduling drafting work around hearing schedules.

### 5. Focus Mode for Drafting

Distraction-free mode that enables deep work on briefs, contracts, and legal documents. Timer tracking for focused sessions that generate billable hours.

### 6. Quick Task Capture

Fast task entry for capturing action items during calls, depositions, and meetings without disrupting the interaction. Ability to assign to matters quickly.

### 7. Security and Confidentiality

Encryption, access controls, and compliance with legal industry security standards. Self-hosting option for firms requiring on-premises data control.

## 1. Open Sunsama – Free Daily Planning for Lawyers

**Price: Free forever | Open source | Self-hostable**

Open Sunsama is a free, open-source daily planner that combines time blocking, built-in time tracking, and a powerful focus mode—giving attorneys the structure they need to manage multiple matters while tracking billable hours effortlessly. Unlike sprawling legal practice management systems, Open Sunsama centers on one question: **what are you accomplishing today?**

### Why Open Sunsama Works for Lawyers

**Matter-Based Project Organization**: Create projects for each active matter. Filter to see only one case's tasks when you need focus, or view everything when planning your week. Clear separation ensures confidentiality during screen shares and reduces mental load when switching between cases.

**Built-in Time Tracking for Billable Hours**: Every focused work session automatically tracks time. Enter focus mode to draft a motion, and the timer runs. When you complete the session, you have accurate billable hour data without manual time entry. Review time by matter for billing reconciliation.

**Calendar-Centric Time Blocking for Court Schedules**: Legal practice lives in the calendar—court dates, depositions, client meetings, filing deadlines. Open Sunsama shows your calendar events alongside tasks, letting you drag drafting work into available time slots. See at a glance whether you have enough focused time for that brief or if hearings have consumed your day.

**[Focus Mode](/features/focus-mode) for Legal Drafting**: Briefs, contracts, and memoranda require deep concentration. Click into any task to enter focus mode—the entire screen shows only your current work, notes, subtasks, and a running timer. Notifications disappear. The task list disappears. Just you and the document.

**Flexible Rescheduling for Legal Chaos**: Continuances happen. Clients escalate emergencies. Opposing counsel files motions that demand immediate response. Open Sunsama makes rescheduling effortless—drag tasks to tomorrow, adjust time blocks, adapt to reality without guilt. Incomplete tasks roll over automatically.

**Command Palette for Call Capture (Cmd+K)**: During client calls and depositions, action items emerge rapidly. The command palette lets you capture tasks in seconds without leaving your notes. "Follow up with expert witness on report" becomes a tracked task instantly.

**Self-Hostable for Data Security**: For firms requiring strict data control, Open Sunsama can be self-hosted on your own infrastructure. Client information never leaves your servers.

### The Attorney Workflow with Open Sunsama

1. **Morning Planning (5 minutes)**: Review your calendar—court appearances, depositions, client calls, blocked drafting time. Identify which matters need progress today. Drag priority tasks to available time blocks, being realistic about hearing-heavy days.

2. **Client Call Capture**: During calls, use Cmd+K to rapidly capture action items and assign them to the relevant matter. They land in context for later review, never interrupting your client conversation.

3. **Focused Drafting Sessions**: When your time block arrives, enter focus mode. The timer tracks billable hours automatically while you draft without distraction. Work in 25-50 minute focused sprints for maximum output.

4. **Matter Context Switching**: Between matters, filter your task list to the next case. Quickly orient to its deadlines, recent activity, and outstanding items before the client call. Clean mental transitions reduce errors and improve client service.

5. **End-of-Day Billing Prep**: Review time tracked by matter throughout the day. Export or reference for entry into your firm's billing system. Accurate contemporaneous records reduce write-offs and improve realization rates.

### Why Free and Open Source Matters for Attorneys

Law practice already involves significant overhead—bar dues, insurance, CLE requirements, legal research subscriptions. Open Sunsama eliminates one more expense:

- **No per-attorney pricing**: Whether you're solo or a mid-sized firm
- **No premium tier**: Time tracking, focus mode, all features available free
- **Open source**: No vendor lock-in, no surprise pivots, no data harvesting
- **Self-hostable**: Client data can stay on your own infrastructure if required by firm policy

### Pricing

Free. No premium tier. No subscription. No feature limitations.

## 2. Clio – Full Legal Practice Management

**Price: $39/month (Lite) | $79/month (Complete) | $129/month (Complete+)**

Clio is the leading cloud-based legal practice management platform, combining case management, time tracking, billing, client intake, and document management in one comprehensive system.

### Why Clio Works for Lawyers

**Legal-Specific Design**: Clio is built exclusively for law firms. Matter management, trust accounting, conflict checks, and court rules calendaring are native features, not afterthoughts.

**Professional Time Tracking**: Track time in standard legal increments (6-minute or 15-minute). Multiple timer options, automatic suggestions based on activity, and integration with billing workflows.

**Court Rules Calendaring**: Automatically calculate deadlines based on jurisdictional court rules. Input a triggering event, and Clio generates response deadlines, discovery cutoffs, and motion filing dates.

**Client Portal**: Secure client communication, document sharing, and invoice viewing—keeping sensitive communications off email.

**Integrations**: Connects with legal research (Westlaw, Lexis), document automation (Clio Draft), court filing systems, and accounting platforms.

### Limitations for Lawyers

- **Expensive**: Starting at $39/month per user, costs escalate quickly for firms. Full features require $79-129/month.
- **Not a daily planner**: Clio tracks matters and deadlines but doesn't help with daily task prioritization or time blocking.
- **No focus mode**: Full practice management interface remains visible—potentially distracting during drafting.
- **Complexity**: Feature-rich means learning curve and maintenance overhead.
- **Overkill for personal productivity**: If you just need daily planning and time tracking, Clio is far more than necessary.

### Who It's Best For

Firms needing comprehensive practice management—matter intake through invoicing. Clio excels as the operational backbone but should be paired with a daily planner like Open Sunsama for individual attorney productivity.

## 3. Todoist – Simple Task Capture for Lawyers

**Price: Free (5 projects) | $4/month (Pro) | $6/user/month (Business)**

Todoist is a lightweight, fast task manager that excels at rapid task capture—valuable for attorneys who need to grab action items during calls, hearings, and depositions.

### Why Todoist Works for Lawyers

**Instant Capture**: Natural language input ("File motion tomorrow 3pm #WilsonCase") creates tasks with dates and project assignment in seconds. Available everywhere—desktop, mobile, browser extension, email integration.

**Projects as Matters**: Create projects for each case to maintain separation. Nest sub-projects for complex matters with multiple workstreams.

**Filters and Views**: Custom filters show tasks due today, this week, or by matter. Priority levels help distinguish urgent deadlines from routine tasks.

**Cross-Platform**: Syncs instantly across all devices. Capture a task on your phone during a deposition break, and it appears on your desktop immediately.

**Integration Friendly**: Connects with calendar apps, email, and other productivity tools.

### Limitations for Lawyers

- **No time tracking**: Todoist tracks tasks but not time spent. You'll need a separate tool for billable hour tracking.
- **No focus mode**: Full task list remains visible while working.
- **Basic deadline handling**: Date reminders exist but no sophisticated deadline calculation or multiple reminder alerts.
- **No calendar integration for time blocking**: Tasks and calendar events remain separate.
- **Limited matter management**: Projects work for separation, but no legal-specific features like conflict checking or court rules.

### Who It's Best For

Attorneys who need lightweight, fast task capture and don't need integrated time tracking. Works well paired with a time tracking tool (like Open Sunsama's built-in tracker) and a calendar for time blocking.

## 4. Sunsama – Guided Daily Planning for Lawyers

**Price: $20/month ($240/year)**

Sunsama is the premium inspiration for Open Sunsama—a daily planner with guided rituals that help attorneys be intentional about daily priorities despite chaotic schedules.

### Why Sunsama Works for Lawyers

**Guided Daily Planning**: Each morning, Sunsama walks you through a planning ritual. For attorneys juggling dozens of matters, this external prompting ensures conscious decisions about priority allocation rather than reactive firefighting.

**Calendar Integration**: Sunsama pulls events from Google Calendar, Outlook, and others, showing the full picture of your day. Tasks and court dates appear together for realistic planning.

**Timeboxing**: Assign time estimates to tasks and see when you've over-committed. Attorneys often underestimate drafting time—Sunsama makes this visible before the day begins.

**Shutdown Ritual**: End-of-day review helps attorneys close matter contexts mentally, reducing the "always on" feeling that leads to burnout.

**Integrations**: Connects with task managers, project tools, and calendars to pull in work from various sources.

### Limitations for Lawyers

- **Expensive**: $240/year adds up alongside other legal overhead (Open Sunsama provides similar features free).
- **Limited time tracking**: Basic timing exists but isn't designed for legal billable hour requirements.
- **Guided rituals take time**: The structured approach takes 10-15 minutes daily—valuable, but some attorneys prefer faster planning.
- **No legal-specific features**: No court rules calendaring, deadline calculation, or matter management.

### Who It's Best For

Attorneys who struggle with intentional planning and benefit from external structure. The guided rituals genuinely help those who otherwise dive into reactive work without prioritizing. However, cost-conscious attorneys should consider Open Sunsama for similar functionality at no cost.

## 5. Motion – AI-Powered Scheduling for Lawyers

**Price: $19/month (Individual) | $12/user/month (Team)**

Motion uses AI to automatically schedule tasks around your calendar, promising to optimize attorney schedules without manual time blocking.

### Why Motion Works for Lawyers

**AI Auto-Scheduling**: Add tasks with deadlines and time estimates. Motion automatically schedules them into available calendar slots, rescheduling when conflicts arise.

**Deadline Intelligence**: Motion prioritizes tasks approaching deadlines, ensuring filings don't slip.

**Calendar-Centric**: Everything lives in the calendar view. Tasks become calendar events automatically.

**Meeting Scheduling**: Built-in meeting scheduler for client calls and depositions, consolidating tools.

### Limitations for Lawyers

- **Limited control**: AI scheduling can feel frustrating when you want specific control over when matter work happens. Attorneys often have preferences about which case to work on when—based on court schedules, client expectations, or mental state.
- **Expensive**: $19/month is premium pricing for individual attorneys.
- **Basic time tracking**: Tracks task completion but isn't designed for legal billable hour requirements.
- **No focus mode**: No dedicated distraction-free mode for drafting work.
- **Learning curve**: AI behavior takes time to understand and train to your preferences.
- **No legal-specific features**: No court rules or deadline calculation.

### Who It's Best For

Attorneys who want to offload scheduling decisions to AI and trust algorithms with their time allocation. Works better for attorneys with flexible schedules than those with rigid court calendars and filing deadlines.

## 6. TimeSolv – Legal-Grade Time Tracking

**Price: $19.95/user/month**

TimeSolv is a dedicated legal time tracking and billing platform designed specifically for law firms and legal departments.

### Why TimeSolv Works for Lawyers

**Legal-Specific Time Tracking**: Track time in standard legal increments. Multiple timer options, matter-based tracking, and billing codes designed for legal workflows.

**LEDES Billing**: Generate invoices in Legal Electronic Data Exchange Standard format required by many corporate clients and insurance companies.

**Matter Budgeting**: Track time against matter budgets to prevent overruns and maintain profitability.

**Expense Tracking**: Log case-related expenses alongside time for complete billing records.

**Trust Accounting**: Manage IOLTA and trust accounts with compliance features.

### Limitations for Lawyers

- **Time tracking only**: TimeSolv tracks time but doesn't help you plan what to work on or manage tasks.
- **No focus mode**: Tracks time but doesn't protect focus or minimize distractions.
- **No calendar integration**: Time blocks don't automatically flow from your calendar.
- **Requires discipline**: You must remember to start and stop timers—easy to forget during busy legal days.
- **Additional cost**: $19.95/month adds to existing software expenses.

### Who It's Best For

Firms needing professional-grade legal time tracking and billing with LEDES support. Works best paired with a daily planner like Open Sunsama for task management and focus, while TimeSolv handles billing.

## 7. Microsoft To Do – Enterprise-Secure Task Management

**Price: Free (with Microsoft 365)**

Microsoft To Do is a straightforward task manager that integrates with the Microsoft 365 ecosystem—valuable for attorneys at firms using Microsoft infrastructure.

### Why Microsoft To Do Works for Lawyers

**Enterprise Security**: Lives within Microsoft's enterprise security framework. Firms using Microsoft 365 already have compliance, encryption, and access controls in place.

**Outlook Integration**: Tasks from flagged emails and Outlook tasks sync automatically. Client emails become trackable action items.

**Simple Matter Lists**: Create lists for each matter. Tasks stay organized by case without complexity.

**My Day View**: Daily planning view shows what you're focusing on today across all lists.

**Free with Microsoft 365**: No additional cost for firms already using Microsoft infrastructure.

### Limitations for Lawyers

- **No time tracking**: Microsoft To Do tracks tasks but not time spent. Separate tool needed for billable hours.
- **No focus mode**: Full task interface remains visible while working.
- **Basic deadline handling**: Due dates exist but no sophisticated alerting or court rules calculation.
- **No calendar time blocking**: Tasks and Outlook calendar remain separate experiences.
- **Limited organization**: Lists work for matter separation, but no legal-specific features.
- **Basic feature set**: Intentionally simple—may feel limited for attorneys wanting more sophisticated planning.

### Who It's Best For

Attorneys at Microsoft-centric firms who need enterprise security compliance and Outlook integration. Works well for basic task tracking but should be supplemented with Open Sunsama for time blocking, focus mode, and billable hour tracking.

## 8. Notion – Document and Task Management for Lawyers

**Price: Free (personal) | $10/month (Plus) | $15/month (Business)**

Notion is a flexible workspace that excels at legal research organization, matter documentation, and case knowledge management—the informational backbone of legal work.

### Why Notion Works for Lawyers

**Matter Workspaces**: Create databases for each case containing research notes, document drafts, deposition summaries, and task checklists. All matter knowledge in one searchable location.

**Template Library**: Build reusable templates for case intake, research memoranda, deposition outlines, and closing checklists. Consistency improves efficiency across matters.

**Knowledge Management**: Maintain legal research, precedent tracking, and practice area expertise in organized databases. Legal knowledge compounds when captured and reusable.

**Flexible Databases**: Track matter status, client CRM data, deadline dashboards, and case timelines in customizable views.

**Document Drafting**: Write and collaborate on documents within Notion, though most attorneys will still use Word for final deliverables.

### Limitations for Lawyers

- **Not a daily planner**: Notion can hold tasks but doesn't provide calendar integration, time blocking, or daily planning workflows.
- **No time tracking**: Manual time entry possible but no timer or automatic tracking.
- **No focus mode**: Full workspace remains visible during work.
- **Complexity risk**: Notion's flexibility means you can spend hours building systems instead of practicing law.
- **Performance**: Large workspaces can become slow, frustrating during client calls.
- **Security concerns**: Some firms prohibit cloud storage of client information. Notion lacks legal-specific compliance certifications.

### Who It's Best For

Attorneys who need robust documentation and knowledge management. Notion excels as the "second brain" for legal knowledge but should be paired with Open Sunsama for daily planning and time tracking.

## Building a Legal Productivity Stack

The best attorney productivity system typically combines specialized tools. Here's how to build a stack that handles legal practice reality.

### The Foundation: Daily Planning and Time Tracking

Choose one tool for daily planning, time blocking, and focus work. **Open Sunsama** covers all three with built-in time tracking—one free tool for the core productivity workflow that generates billable hours.

### Practice Management Layer (If Needed)

For full matter management, billing, and firm operations, add Clio or similar practice management software. But for solo practitioners and small firms, Open Sunsama plus a simple billing tool may be sufficient.

### Documentation Layer

Use Notion for matter knowledge management, research organization, and templates. Keep case notes, document drafts, and research organized by matter.

### Example Attorney Stacks

**Solo Attorney (Minimal)**:
- Open Sunsama (free) for daily planning, time blocking, focus mode, and time tracking
- Simple billing software for invoicing

**Solo Attorney (Documentation-Heavy)**:
- Open Sunsama (free) for daily planning and time tracking
- Notion (free/paid) for matter documentation and legal research
- Simple billing software

**Small Firm (5-20 attorneys)**:
- Open Sunsama for individual attorney daily planning and focus
- Clio or similar for firm-wide practice management
- Notion for shared knowledge management
- Microsoft To Do for Outlook-centric attorneys (optional)

**Large Firm (Enterprise)**:
- Open Sunsama for individual productivity (self-hosted if required)
- Enterprise practice management system
- Microsoft ecosystem for security compliance

## Tracking Billable Hours with Time Blocking

Time blocking is especially valuable for attorneys who must protect drafting time from meeting creep while tracking billable hours accurately.

### The Billable Block Method

1. **Review tomorrow's calendar** for court appearances, calls, and meetings
2. **Identify available time slots** for billable matter work
3. **Block specific matters** into specific time slots based on deadlines and priorities
4. **Treat blocks as court appearances**—don't let internal meetings override them
5. **Enter focus mode** during blocks to track time automatically
6. **Log time immediately** after each block while context is fresh

### The Six-Minute Increment Approach

Most firms bill in six-minute (0.1 hour) increments. To maximize capture:

1. **Track time in focus sessions** of at least 12-18 minutes (0.2-0.3 hours)
2. **Note task descriptions** within each session for accurate billing narratives
3. **Batch small tasks** (emails, quick calls) into consolidated time entries
4. **Review daily** before time becomes stale and details are forgotten

### Protecting Drafting Time

1. **Block drafting time before meetings fill your calendar**—schedule at the start of each week
2. **Make blocks visible**—mark as "Busy" so partners and staff don't schedule over them
3. **Use buffer time**—never schedule back-to-back court appearances; protect preparation time
4. **Batch similar work**—all brief writing in one block, all contract review in another

## Managing Case Deadlines Effectively

Court deadlines have consequences other business deadlines don't share. Here's how to manage them systematically.

### Multiple Reminder Levels

For every court deadline, set reminders at:
- **2-4 weeks out**: Begin substantive work
- **1 week out**: Draft should be complete for review
- **2-3 days out**: Final review and filing prep
- **Day of**: Filing confirmation

### Deadline Dashboard

Maintain visibility into all upcoming deadlines across matters:

1. **Weekly review**: Scan all deadlines in the next 30 days
2. **Flag approaching dates**: Anything within 2 weeks gets priority attention
3. **Identify conflicts**: Multiple deadlines on the same day need advance planning
4. **Calendar integration**: Deadlines should appear alongside court dates and meetings

### Court Rules Automation

For complex litigation, use dedicated court rules calculators (Clio, Deadlines.com) to:
- Calculate response deadlines from triggering events
- Account for jurisdictional variations
- Handle holiday and weekend adjustments
- Generate full deadline calendars from case events

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the best productivity app for lawyers?

**Open Sunsama** is our top recommendation for lawyers because it combines matter-based project organization, built-in time tracking for billable hours, calendar-integrated time blocking, and a powerful focus mode for drafting work—all for free. Unlike generic task managers, Open Sunsama addresses the legal reality of multiple matters, billable hour requirements, and calendar chaos. The focus mode is particularly valuable for producing briefs and legal documents between court appearances and client calls.

### How do lawyers track billable hours efficiently?

The most efficient approach is integrated time tracking that runs automatically during focused work. Open Sunsama's focus mode includes a timer that tracks time as you work on matter tasks—no manual start/stop or separate time entry required. At day's end, review time by matter for billing entry. For firms needing legal-specific features like LEDES billing, TimeSolv and Clio offer dedicated legal time tracking.

### What productivity tools do BigLaw associates use?

Large firm associates typically work within firm-mandated systems: enterprise practice management (Clio, NetDocuments), firm-provided time tracking, and Microsoft 365. For personal productivity, many associates add individual planning tools like Open Sunsama or Sunsama to manage their daily priorities and protect focused drafting time. The key is finding tools that complement rather than conflict with firm infrastructure.

### How do I manage multiple cases without missing deadlines?

Use a productivity tool with strong matter separation like Open Sunsama. Create a project for each active case, ensuring every task belongs to a matter context. During daily planning, review all matters to ensure nothing is forgotten. For court deadlines specifically, maintain a separate deadline dashboard with multiple reminder alerts, and consider legal-specific calendaring tools that calculate deadlines from court rules.

### Is there a free productivity app for solo attorneys?

**Open Sunsama** is completely free with no premium tier or limitations. It includes matter organization, time tracking, calendar integration, and focus mode—features typically locked behind subscriptions in other apps. For solo practitioners managing multiple matters with billable hour requirements, this eliminates subscription overhead while providing professional-grade productivity tools. It's also self-hostable for attorneys with strict data security requirements.

### How do lawyers stay focused during long drafting sessions?

Use time blocking to schedule specific drafting work in available calendar gaps. When your blocked time arrives, enter focus mode to eliminate distractions. The Pomodoro technique (25-50 minute focused sessions with short breaks) works well for legal drafting. Open Sunsama's focus mode hides everything except your current task and runs a timer, making focused sessions more productive and automatically tracking billable time.

### Should lawyers use legal practice management software or general productivity tools?

It depends on your needs. **Practice management software** (Clio, MyCase) handles the full firm operation: matter intake, billing, trust accounting, document management, and conflict checking. **Productivity tools** (Open Sunsama, Todoist) handle daily planning, task management, and personal focus. Most attorneys benefit from both—practice management for firm operations, productivity tools for individual execution. Solo practitioners with simple practices may find Open Sunsama sufficient for daily work plus basic billing software.

### What's the best way to separate client matters?

Use project-based organization where each matter is a separate project in your task manager. Filter to single projects when doing focused case work—this prevents other matters' tasks from distracting you and protects confidentiality during screen shares. Open Sunsama's project filtering makes this seamless. For documentation, maintain separate workspaces or clearly separated databases in tools like Notion.

### How do attorneys balance billable work and administrative tasks?

Treat administrative tasks (billing, marketing, CLE) like matters—create projects and schedule time blocks for them. Without explicit calendar protection, billable work always wins because it has immediate deadlines and revenue impact. The 80/15/5 rule works for many attorneys: 80% billable client work, 15% business development and administration, 5% professional development. Track administrative time separately to understand where non-billable hours go. (For general management planning strategies, see [best daily planner apps for managers](/blog/best-daily-planner-managers).)

### Can I use Open Sunsama for my entire law firm?

Yes. Open Sunsama works for individual attorneys and can scale to firms of any size since it's free with no per-user pricing. Each attorney manages their own daily planning, time tracking, and focus work, while firm-wide matters can be organized as shared projects. For firms requiring on-premises data storage, Open Sunsama is self-hostable. Larger firms may still want practice management software (Clio) for billing, trust accounting, and firm operations, with Open Sunsama handling individual attorney productivity.
