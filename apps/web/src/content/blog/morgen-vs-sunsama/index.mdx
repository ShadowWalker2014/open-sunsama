Morgen and Sunsama both sit at the intersection of calendar management and task planning—but they approach this space from fundamentally different angles. Understanding these differences is crucial for choosing the right tool for your workflow.

Morgen positions itself as a calendar unification layer. It aggregates all your calendars into one beautiful interface, adds scheduling links for meetings, and provides basic task management. At $14/month (billed annually), it's designed for users who want a better calendar experience without leaving their existing tools behind.

Sunsama takes a task-first approach wrapped in calendar integration. It guides you through daily planning rituals, pulls tasks from dozens of productivity tools, and helps you deliberately schedule work onto your calendar. At $20/month (billed annually), it's aimed at knowledge workers who want to be more intentional about their daily choices.

In this comprehensive Morgen vs Sunsama comparison, we'll examine both calendar planner apps in detail—features, pricing, platform support, and ideal use cases. We'll also introduce Open Sunsama, a free open-source alternative that combines the best of both approaches.

Now let's examine each daily planner app in detail.

## What is Morgen?

Morgen is a calendar aggregation and scheduling app designed to unify your scattered calendar accounts into one cohesive experience. Founded in Switzerland, it has grown into a polished productivity tool that sits between traditional calendar apps and full-fledged daily planners.

### How Morgen Works

Morgen's core value proposition is calendar unification. Instead of juggling Google Calendar for work, Outlook for meetings, and Apple Calendar for personal events, Morgen pulls everything into one clean interface. You can view, create, and modify events across all accounts from a single dashboard.

The workflow is straightforward:

1. **Connect your calendars**: Link Google Calendar, Outlook, Microsoft 365, Apple Calendar, Fastmail, and other providers
2. **View unified schedule**: See all events across accounts in one calendar view
3. **Create scheduling links**: Generate booking pages so others can schedule meetings with you
4. **Add tasks**: Create basic tasks and drag them onto your calendar as time blocks
5. **Automate with Morgen Assist**: Set up calendar propagation and workflow automation

Importantly, Morgen doesn't replace your existing calendars—it layers on top of them. Events sync bidirectionally, so changes made in Morgen appear in your native calendar apps.

### Morgen's Key Features

**Calendar Unification**: This is Morgen's signature capability. Connect unlimited calendar accounts from different providers and see them all in one view. Color-code different calendars, show or hide specific accounts, and manage your entire calendar ecosystem from one app.

**Scheduling Links**: Create booking pages that let others schedule time with you. Define your availability, buffer time between meetings, and generate shareable links. This competes directly with tools like Calendly and Cal.com.

**Morgen Assist**: An AI-powered feature set that includes calendar propagation (automatically copying events between calendars), travel time calculations, and team focus time optimization. These automations help maintain calendar hygiene without manual work.

**Basic Task Management**: Add tasks with due dates and drag them onto your calendar. The task management is intentionally simple—Morgen assumes you track detailed tasks elsewhere and use Morgen primarily for scheduling.

**Cross-Platform Support**: Morgen runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and web browsers. True cross-platform availability is a significant advantage over Apple-only alternatives.

**Team Features**: For teams, Morgen shows availability overlap and helps find optimal meeting times. The "Team Focus" feature can reschedule flexible meetings to create uninterrupted focus blocks.

### Morgen Pricing in 2026

Morgen offers a tiered pricing structure:

**Free (Basic)** includes:
- 1 calendar account
- Unlimited calendar subscriptions
- Personal booking page
- Basic features

**Pro Plan**: $14/month (annual) or $21/month (monthly)
- Unlimited calendar accounts
- Full Morgen Assist features
- Advanced booking pages
- Mobile app access
- Calendar automations

**Team Plan**: Per-seat pricing with additional collaboration features
- Team availability visualization
- Meeting optimization
- 60% savings on annual billing

Special discounts are available: 25% off for students, academics, and nonprofits; 15% off first year when switching from Motion, Reclaim, Fantastical, or Sunsama.

### Morgen's Limitations

**Basic Task Management**: Morgen's task features are intentionally barebones—task name and deadline, nothing more. No subtasks, no tags, no priorities, no rich notes. If you need comprehensive task management, you'll pair Morgen with another tool.

**No Native Calendar**: Morgen requires connecting an external calendar account. It can't function standalone—you must already use Google Calendar, Outlook, or another provider.

**Mobile App Restricted to Paid Tier**: Unlike most apps, Morgen's mobile app requires a Pro subscription. Building the habit of mobile calendar checking requires paying.

**Limited Integrations**: While Morgen integrates with Todoist, ClickUp, Linear, and Notion for task import, the integration depth doesn't match Sunsama's extensive two-way sync capabilities.

**No Daily Planning Process**: Morgen doesn't guide you through intentional daily planning. It's a calendar tool with task scheduling, not a daily planning methodology.

## What is Sunsama?

Sunsama is a daily planning application built around mindful, intentional productivity. Unlike Morgen's calendar-first approach, Sunsama centers on helping you consciously decide what deserves your time each day. It integrates deeply with task management tools and guides users through structured planning rituals.

### How Sunsama Works

Sunsama's core experience is the daily planning ritual—a guided process you complete each morning:

1. **Review your calendar**: See existing meetings and commitments
2. **Pull in tasks**: Import tasks from connected tools (Todoist, Asana, Notion, Linear, Trello, etc.)
3. **Set daily intentions**: Consciously choose what you'll accomplish today
4. **Estimate time**: Add duration estimates to each task
5. **Time block your schedule**: Drag tasks onto specific calendar times
6. **Check capacity**: Sunsama warns if you've scheduled more than realistic

Throughout the day, you work through time blocks using focus mode. At day's end, an optional shutdown ritual helps you reflect and roll incomplete tasks forward.

### Sunsama's Key Features

**Guided Daily Planning**: The morning ritual is Sunsama's philosophical foundation. You deliberately choose what matters today rather than reactively working through an endless task list.

**Extensive Integrations**: This is where Sunsama excels. Native two-way sync with Todoist, Trello, Asana, Notion, ClickUp, Jira, Linear, GitHub, Gmail, Slack, and more. Tasks flow from source systems into your daily plan; changes sync back.

**Focus Mode**: When working on a task, [focus mode](/features/focus-mode) expands it to fill your screen, starts a timer, and minimizes distractions. Pomodoro timer support structures deep work sessions.

**Two-Way Calendar Sync**: Full bidirectional [calendar sync](/features/calendar-sync) with Google Calendar, Outlook, and iCloud. Time blocks appear on your external calendar; events from your calendar appear in Sunsama.

**Overplanning Prevention**: Sunsama tracks estimated task durations and warns when you've scheduled more than can realistically be accomplished—promoting sustainable productivity over burnout.

**Weekly Review**: Beyond daily planning, Sunsama provides weekly review features to assess progress, understand time allocation, and plan the week ahead.

### Sunsama Pricing in 2026

Sunsama maintains premium positioning:

- **Monthly**: $25/month
- **Annual**: $20/month (billed as $240/year)
- **14-day free trial** (no credit card required)

There is no free tier. Sunsama's pricing reflects its positioning as a professional tool for knowledge workers who value intentional productivity.

### Sunsama's Limitations

**No Scheduling Links**: Unlike Morgen, Sunsama doesn't offer booking pages or scheduling links. You'll need a separate tool like Calendly if you frequently schedule meetings.

**No Calendar Unification**: Sunsama syncs with calendars but doesn't serve as a calendar replacement. It's designed to pull calendar events into your planning view, not to manage multiple calendar accounts.

**High Price Point**: At $240/year, Sunsama costs significantly more than Morgen. For budget-conscious users, this premium pricing requires justification.

**Limited Team Features**: Sunsama is designed for individual productivity. No shared calendars, no task delegation, no team visibility features.

**Desktop-First Design**: While Sunsama has mobile apps, the experience is optimized for desktop. Mobile planning feels secondary compared to the web and desktop applications.

## Morgen vs Sunsama: Feature-by-Feature Comparison

Let's compare these calendar planner apps across the features that matter most for daily productivity.

### Calendar Management

**Morgen**: Calendar unification is Morgen's core strength. Connect unlimited accounts from Google, Outlook, Microsoft 365, Apple Calendar, and more. View, create, and edit events across all calendars from one interface. Bidirectional sync keeps everything in harmony.

**Sunsama**: Connects to your calendars to display events in your planning view. Full two-way sync means time blocks you create appear on external calendars. However, Sunsama isn't designed to replace your calendar app—it's a planning layer on top.

**Verdict**: Morgen wins for calendar management. If unifying multiple calendar accounts is your primary need, Morgen is purpose-built for this.

### Task Management

**Morgen**: Basic task management with name and deadline. No subtasks, priorities, tags, or rich notes. Designed for simple tasks you'll time-block on your calendar. Complex task management requires pairing with another tool.

**Sunsama**: Comprehensive task management with subtasks, notes, time estimates, and project organization. More importantly, Sunsama pulls tasks from dozens of external tools, so you can manage tasks where they originate while planning them in Sunsama.

**Verdict**: Sunsama wins decisively. If task management matters, Sunsama's depth and integrations are significantly more powerful.

### Daily Planning Process

**Morgen**: No guided planning process. Open the app, view your calendar, add tasks as needed. Flexibility is high, but intentionality depends entirely on user discipline.

**Sunsama**: Structured morning ritual walks you through reviewing commitments, pulling in tasks, setting intentions, and time blocking. The app actively shapes your planning mindset.

**Verdict**: Sunsama wins for those who benefit from guided planning. Morgen wins for users who prefer flexibility.

### Integrations

**Morgen**: Integrates with Todoist, ClickUp, Linear, Notion, and video conferencing tools like Zoom and Microsoft Teams. Task integrations allow pulling tasks into Morgen for calendar scheduling.

**Sunsama**: Extensive native integrations with Todoist, Trello, Asana, Notion, ClickUp, Jira, Linear, GitHub, Gmail, Slack, and more. Two-way sync means changes flow bidirectionally between Sunsama and source systems.

**Verdict**: Sunsama wins on integration breadth and depth—particularly valuable if you use multiple productivity tools.

### Scheduling and Booking

**Morgen**: Built-in scheduling links and booking pages. Define availability, set buffer times, and share links for others to schedule with you. Competes with dedicated scheduling tools.

**Sunsama**: No scheduling link feature. External tools like Calendly required for booking functionality.

**Verdict**: Morgen wins clearly. If you schedule meetings with external parties, Morgen's built-in booking pages add significant value.

### Focus and Deep Work

**Morgen**: No dedicated focus features. Time blocking is available, but there's no focus mode, timer, or distraction management.

**Sunsama**: Full focus mode with task expansion, Pomodoro timer, and minimal distraction interface. Designed to help you execute, not just plan.

**Verdict**: Sunsama wins for focus support.

### Platform Support

**Morgen**: Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, web browser. True cross-platform coverage, though mobile requires paid subscription.

**Sunsama**: Web, Mac, Windows, iOS, Android. No Linux support. Mobile apps exist but are secondary to desktop experience.

**Verdict**: Morgen wins slightly for Linux support and web-first design. Both offer solid cross-platform coverage.

## Pricing Comparison: Morgen vs Sunsama

Understanding the cost difference helps determine value:

| Timeframe | Morgen Pro | Sunsama | Difference |
|-----------|-----------|---------|------------|
| **Monthly** | $21/month | $25/month | $4/month |
| **Annual** | $168/year | $240/year | $72/year |
| **3 Years** | $504 | $720 | $216 |

Over three years, Sunsama costs $216 more than Morgen. The question is whether Sunsama's deeper task management, integrations, and focus features justify the premium.

**Morgen makes sense** if you primarily need calendar unification and scheduling links. The task management and planning features are bonuses rather than core value.

**Sunsama makes sense** if you need extensive integrations, guided daily planning, and task-first workflow. The price premium buys significantly more productivity methodology.

**Neither makes sense** if you want full features without subscription costs—which brings us to Open Sunsama.

## When Morgen Makes Sense

Morgen is the right choice if you:

- **Manage multiple calendar accounts**: You have Google Calendar for work, Outlook for specific clients, and Apple Calendar for personal—and need them unified.
- **Schedule meetings frequently**: Built-in booking pages eliminate the need for separate scheduling tools like Calendly.
- **Want a better calendar experience**: Morgen's interface is significantly more polished than native Google Calendar or Outlook.
- **Prefer flexibility over process**: You don't want guided planning rituals—just a better calendar with basic task support.
- **Need team scheduling features**: Finding meeting times across team members' calendars is a regular need.
- **Use Linux**: Morgen's Linux support makes it one of few options for Linux users seeking premium calendar experiences.

**Best for**: Calendar power users, meeting schedulers, multi-calendar managers, and those who want to enhance rather than replace their existing calendar workflow. Also compare [Google Calendar vs Sunsama](/blog/google-calendar-vs-sunsama) and [Fantastical vs Sunsama](/blog/fantastical-vs-sunsama).

## When Sunsama Makes Sense

Sunsama is the right choice if you:

- **Use multiple productivity tools**: Tasks live in Asana, Notion, Linear, and email—you need them unified for daily planning without abandoning source systems.
- **Value intentional planning**: Guided morning rituals help you be more deliberate about daily choices rather than reacting to whatever feels urgent.
- **Need focus mode support**: Deep work requires more than scheduling—you need execution support with timers and distraction reduction.
- **Track time estimates**: Understanding how long tasks take helps you plan realistically and avoid overcommitment.
- **Want weekly reviews**: Beyond daily planning, you want to assess weekly progress and plan strategically.
- **Can justify premium pricing**: $240/year is reasonable for a tool central to your productivity system.

**Best for**: Knowledge workers, professionals using multiple project management systems, and those who value mindfulness in productivity.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the main difference between Morgen and Sunsama?

**Morgen** is a calendar unification and scheduling tool that aggregates multiple calendar accounts, provides booking pages, and adds basic task management. **Sunsama** is a task-first daily planner that pulls tasks from multiple productivity tools and guides you through intentional planning rituals. Morgen excels at calendar management; Sunsama excels at task planning methodology.

### Is Morgen worth it for the Morgen app alternative to Google Calendar?

Morgen provides a significantly better experience than Google Calendar if you: manage multiple calendar accounts, need scheduling links, or want a more polished interface. The free tier offers a meaningful upgrade from native Google Calendar. However, if you only use one calendar and don't schedule external meetings, the value proposition is weaker.

### Can I use Morgen and Sunsama together?

Technically yes—Morgen can serve as your calendar layer while Sunsama handles daily planning. However, this creates redundancy and complexity. Most users choose one or the other based on whether calendar management or task planning is their primary need.

### Which is better for a best calendar planner app?

It depends on your priorities. **Morgen** is better if calendar unification and scheduling links are primary needs. **Sunsama** is better if task management and intentional daily planning are primary needs. **Open Sunsama** is best if you want comprehensive features without subscription costs.

### Does Morgen have a free tier?

Yes. Morgen's free tier includes one calendar account, unlimited calendar subscriptions, and a personal booking page. However, mobile app access and advanced features require the Pro subscription at $14/month (annual).

### Can Morgen replace Calendly?

Morgen's scheduling links compete with Calendly for basic booking needs—defining availability, setting buffer times, and sharing booking links. For advanced features like team scheduling, payment collection, or extensive customization, Calendly remains more capable.

### Is Sunsama worth $240/year?

Sunsama's value depends on how central daily planning is to your productivity. Users who benefit from guided planning rituals, extensive integrations with tools like Asana and Notion, and focus mode support often find the investment worthwhile. If you have simpler needs, the cost may be harder to justify.

**Sunsama** has significantly more integrations with deeper two-way sync. It connects to Todoist, Trello, Asana, Notion, ClickUp, Jira, Linear, GitHub, Gmail, Slack, and more. **Morgen** integrates with fewer tools (Todoist, ClickUp, Linear, Notion) and focuses more on calendar providers than task management systems.

### Does Morgen work on Linux?

### Can I self-host Morgen or Sunsama?
