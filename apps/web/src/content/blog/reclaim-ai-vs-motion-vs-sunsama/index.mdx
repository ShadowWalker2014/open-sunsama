The AI scheduling tools market has exploded. Between Reclaim AI, Motion, and Sunsama, professionals have more options than ever for managing their time. But each tool takes a fundamentally different approach: Reclaim protects your calendar from meeting overload, Motion automates your entire day, and Sunsama guides you through mindful daily planning.

Choosing between these tools isn't about features—it's about philosophy. Do you want AI to defend your focus time? Schedule everything automatically? Or guide you through intentional decisions about your day?

In this comprehensive Reclaim AI vs Motion comparison, we'll break down exactly how each tool works, what they cost, and who they're best for. We'll also introduce Open Sunsama, a free alternative that combines the best ideas from all three without the subscription cost.

Now let's examine each tool in detail.

## What is Reclaim AI?

Reclaim AI is a calendar assistant that automatically protects time for focused work, habits, and breaks. Founded in 2019, Reclaim positions itself as the AI layer on top of your existing calendar—it doesn't replace Google Calendar or Outlook, it makes them smarter.

### How Reclaim AI Works

Unlike Motion, which schedules your entire day, Reclaim focuses on *defending* your calendar. You tell it what matters—exercise at 7am, focused coding time in the morning, lunch at noon—and Reclaim automatically blocks those times. When meetings try to intrude, Reclaim's "smart events" can flex or hold firm based on priority.

The key concept is "time defense." Reclaim events start as flexible (showing as free), but as your calendar fills up and the deadline approaches, they automatically harden to busy. This way, colleagues can book over low-priority blocks early in the week, but your critical habits become protected as time runs out.

### Reclaim AI Key Features

**Focus Time Protection**: Set a weekly goal for deep work hours (say, 20 hours), and Reclaim automatically finds and defends time blocks across your week. As meetings fill your calendar, it fights to maintain your minimum.

**Smart Habits**: Schedule recurring routines—morning exercise, lunch, email processing, 1:1 prep—and Reclaim finds optimal times that work around your meetings. Habits auto-reschedule when conflicts arise.

**Buffer Time**: Automatically add breaks between meetings and travel time before in-person events. No more back-to-back Zoom fatigue.

**Scheduling Links**: Share availability for meetings with intelligent priority settings. Like Calendly, but aware of your defended time.

**Smart Meetings**: For recurring 1:1s and team meetings, Reclaim finds times that work for everyone and auto-reschedules when conflicts arise.

**Calendar Sync**: Keep multiple calendars in sync—personal and work—so events on one block time on the other.

### Reclaim AI Pricing in 2026

Reclaim offers a genuine free tier, making it the most accessible of the AI scheduling tools:

| Plan | Price (Annual) | Price (Monthly) | Best For |
|------|---------------|----------------|----------|
| **Lite** | Free | Free | Solo users, basic habits |
| **Starter** | $10/seat/month | $12/seat/month | Small teams (up to 10) |
| **Business** | $15/seat/month | $18/seat/month | Large teams (up to 100) |
| **Enterprise** | $22/seat/month | Contact sales | 100+ seats, SSO |

The free Lite plan includes unlimited tasks, one habit, one scheduling link, and basic calendar features. Paid plans unlock unlimited habits, more scheduling links, team analytics, and integrations with Slack, Asana, Todoist, and more.

### Reclaim AI Limitations

**Not a Full Planner**: Reclaim defends time but doesn't help you decide *what* to work on. It's a calendar layer, not a productivity system.

**No Focus Mode**: While Reclaim blocks focus time, it doesn't help you actually focus during that time. No timer, no task expansion, no distraction hiding.

**Habit-Centric**: The tool works best for people with regular routines. If your schedule is chaotic and unpredictable, the habit model may feel constraining.

**Google/Outlook Only**: No support for iCloud Calendar or other providers.

## What is Motion?

Motion is an AI scheduling app that automatically plans your entire day. When you add tasks with deadlines and durations, Motion's algorithm slots them into your calendar, considering meetings, priorities, and working hours. It's the most automated option in this comparison.

### How Motion Works

Motion takes full control. You input tasks, set deadlines, and estimate durations. Motion then creates your optimal schedule—deciding not just *when* to work, but *what* to work on at any given moment. If a meeting runs long or priorities shift, Motion automatically reschedules everything.

This appeals to people who hate planning. Rather than spending 15 minutes each morning deciding what to work on, Motion decides for you. Your job is just to follow the schedule and mark tasks complete.

### Motion Key Features

**AI Auto-Scheduling**: The flagship feature. Add a task, and Motion finds the best time slot based on deadlines, priorities, and your calendar. Truly hands-off scheduling.

**Project Management**: Unlike Reclaim and Sunsama, Motion includes project management features—task lists, Gantt charts (Business tier), and team workspaces.

**Dynamic Rescheduling**: When something changes—a meeting runs over, a new urgent task appears—Motion automatically adjusts your entire day.

**Meeting Scheduler**: Built-in scheduling links for booking meetings, similar to Calendly.

**Productivity Analytics**: Business tier includes dashboards showing time allocation, task completion, and productivity trends.

**Team Features**: Shared projects, workload balancing, and team capacity planning.

### Motion Pricing in 2026

Motion is the most expensive option with no free tier:

| Plan | Price (Annual) | Price (Monthly) |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| **Pro AI** | $19/month | $34/month |
| **Business AI** | $29/month | Contact sales |

Both tiers include a 7-day free trial. Motion's pricing reflects its all-in-one ambition—it's trying to replace both your calendar app and task manager.

### Motion Limitations

**Loss of Control**: Some people find AI-scheduled days disorienting. When the algorithm reschedules your afternoon without asking, it can feel like you've lost agency over your own time.

**Overkill for Some**: If you have a simple schedule and don't need project management, Motion's complexity may be more than you need.

**Limited Integrations**: Motion has fewer integrations than Sunsama. No native Notion, Trello, or GitHub connections—you need Zapier workarounds.

**No Focus Mode**: Despite optimizing your schedule, Motion doesn't help with the actual work. No deep work timer or distraction-hiding features.

**Expensive**: At $19-34/month, Motion costs more than alternatives. That's $228-408/year for an individual.

## What is Sunsama?

Sunsama is a daily planner built around mindful, intentional planning. Rather than automating your day, Sunsama guides you through conscious decisions about what deserves your time. The app emphasizes sustainable productivity over relentless optimization.

### How Sunsama Works

Each morning, Sunsama walks you through a planning ritual. You review your calendar, pull in tasks from connected tools (Todoist, Trello, Asana, Notion, Gmail, etc.), and deliberately choose what to accomplish today. The app warns if you're overplanning—acknowledging that humans have limits.

During the day, you manually drag tasks onto your calendar as time blocks. An optional shutdown ritual at day's end helps you reflect and roll incomplete tasks forward.

### Sunsama Key Features

**Daily Planning Ritual**: Guided morning sessions help set realistic goals. This isn't overhead—it's the core practice.

**Focus Mode**: Expand a task to fill your screen, start a timer, and minimize distractions. Includes Pomodoro support.

**Extensive Integrations**: Two-way sync with Todoist, Trello, Asana, Notion, ClickUp, Jira, Linear, GitHub, Gmail, Slack, and more. Best-in-class for pulling tasks from multiple sources.

**Overplanning Warnings**: The app tracks estimated time and alerts when you've scheduled more than realistic.

**Calm Interface**: Deliberately minimal design. Sparse, focused, and surprisingly soothing.

**Shutdown Ritual**: Evening reflection on what you accomplished and what rolls to tomorrow.

### Sunsama Pricing in 2026

Sunsama recently raised prices after years of holding steady:

| Plan | Price |
|------|-------|
| **Monthly** | $25/month |
| **Annual** | $20/month ($240/year) |

A 14-day free trial is available, no credit card required. Like Motion, there's no free tier.

### Sunsama Limitations

**No AI Automation**: Everything is manual. If you want software to schedule your day, look elsewhere.

**Individual Focus Only**: No team features, shared projects, or collaboration tools.

**No Meeting Scheduler**: You'll need separate tools like Calendly.

**Premium Price**: At $240/year, Sunsama costs more than some competitors with less automation.

## Reclaim AI vs Motion: Feature Comparison

Let's directly compare the two most AI-automated options.

### AI Philosophy

**Reclaim AI**: Defensive AI. Protects time for what matters while working around your existing commitments. You still decide what to work on—Reclaim just ensures you have time for it.

**Motion**: Offensive AI. Takes full control, deciding both when and what you work on. Maximum automation, minimum decision-making.

**Verdict**: Reclaim for those who want AI assistance with human control. Motion for those who want AI to decide everything.

### Focus Time

**Reclaim AI**: Strong focus time features. Set a weekly goal (e.g., 20 hours), and Reclaim automatically defends blocks across your week. Priority settings control how hard it fights for this time.

**Motion**: No dedicated focus time feature. Your tasks are your focus time—Motion schedules work periods, but doesn't specifically protect uninterrupted blocks.

**Verdict**: Reclaim wins for focus time protection.

### Task Scheduling

**Reclaim AI**: Tasks sync from integrations (Todoist, Asana, ClickUp, Jira, Linear) and get auto-scheduled like habits. Less sophisticated than Motion's full scheduling.

**Motion**: Core strength. Every task gets optimal scheduling based on deadlines, durations, and priorities. The most automated approach.

**Verdict**: Motion wins for comprehensive task scheduling.

### Team Features

**Reclaim AI**: Strong team features including Smart Meetings (auto-schedule recurring team meetings), scheduling links, shared no-meeting days, and people analytics.

**Motion**: Project management focus with shared workspaces, Gantt charts, and team workload views. More comprehensive for project tracking.

**Verdict**: Reclaim for calendar coordination, Motion for project management.

### Pricing

**Reclaim AI**: Free tier available. Paid plans from $10-22/seat/month (annual).

**Motion**: No free tier. $19-29/month (annual).

**Verdict**: Reclaim wins on value with its free tier and lower paid pricing.

## When AI Scheduling Works Best

AI scheduling tools like Reclaim and Motion excel in specific situations:

**Predictable Routines**: If you have regular habits—morning exercise, daily standup, weekly 1:1s—AI scheduling maintains consistency.

**Meeting-Heavy Calendars**: When your calendar is constantly under assault from meeting requests, AI defense (Reclaim) or automatic rescheduling (Motion) reduces coordination overhead.

**Deadline-Driven Work**: Motion shines when you have multiple tasks with hard deadlines. It ensures everything gets done by optimizing the schedule.

**Team Coordination**: Reclaim's smart meetings and scheduling links reduce the back-and-forth of finding times that work for everyone.

**Decision Fatigue**: If choosing what to work on exhausts you, Motion's full automation eliminates that burden entirely.

## When Manual Planning is Better

AI scheduling isn't always the answer. Manual tools like Sunsama (or Open Sunsama) work better for:

**Creative Work**: Creative projects don't fit neat time boxes. Sometimes you need to follow inspiration, not a schedule. AI scheduling interrupts flow.

**Autonomy Matters**: Some people need to feel in control of their day. When algorithms reschedule without asking, it feels disempowering.

**Variable Energy**: Human energy fluctuates. Some mornings you're sharp; some afternoons you're drained. Manual planning lets you match tasks to energy.

**Meaningful Work**: Sunsama's planning ritual forces you to ask: "Does this deserve my time today?" That reflection is lost when AI decides everything.

**Simple Schedules**: If you only have a few things to do, AI scheduling is overkill. Manual planning takes 5 minutes and gives you full control.

**Budget Constraints**: Sunsama costs $240/year; Motion costs $228-348/year; Reclaim's useful features require at least $120/year. Manual planning is free.

## Open Sunsama: The Free Alternative

What if you want Sunsama's intentional planning philosophy without the $240/year price tag? Or Reclaim's focus protection without the monthly subscription?

Open Sunsama is a free, open-source daily planner that combines the best ideas from all three tools:

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Reclaim AI better than Motion for scheduling?

It depends on your needs. **Reclaim AI** is better if you want to protect focus time and habits while keeping control of what you work on—it defends your calendar without taking over. **Motion** is better if you want complete automation where AI decides your entire schedule. Reclaim is also more affordable with a free tier, while Motion requires a paid subscription from day one.

### What is the best AI calendar app in 2026?

The best AI calendar app depends on your workflow. **Reclaim AI** is best for protecting focus time and scheduling habits around meetings. **Motion** is best for full automation where AI plans your entire day. **Sunsama** is best for guided manual planning with excellent integrations. **Open Sunsama** is best if you want free, open-source planning without AI lock-in.

### Can I use Reclaim AI for free?

Yes. Reclaim AI offers a free Lite plan that includes unlimited tasks, one habit, one scheduling link, and basic calendar features. The free tier is limited to one user and a one-week scheduling range. For unlimited habits, more scheduling links, and team features, you'll need a paid plan starting at $10/seat/month.

### Is Sunsama worth $20 per month?

Sunsama is worth the price if you value intentional planning rituals, excellent integrations with tools like Todoist and Notion, and a calm interface designed for focus. It's less worthwhile if you want AI automation (Sunsama is fully manual) or team features (it's individual-focused). If budget is a concern, Open Sunsama offers similar intentional planning features for free.

### What's the difference between Reclaim AI and Sunsama?

**Reclaim AI** uses AI to automatically protect focus time and schedule habits around your meetings—it's a calendar defense tool. **Sunsama** is a manual daily planner that guides you through intentional planning rituals—it's about mindful decision-making, not automation. Reclaim optimizes your schedule; Sunsama helps you think about what deserves your time.

### Does Motion or Reclaim have better integrations?

**Reclaim AI** has better integrations overall, especially with task management tools like Todoist, Asana, ClickUp, Jira, and Linear. Reclaim also integrates with Slack for status sync. **Motion** has more limited integrations—primarily calendar sync with Google and Outlook, plus Zoom. For deep integrations with multiple tools, Reclaim or Sunsama are stronger choices.

### Is there a free alternative to Motion and Reclaim?

Yes. **Open Sunsama** is a free, open-source daily planner with time blocking, focus mode, and calendar sync. While it doesn't have Motion's full AI automation or Reclaim's smart habits, it provides the core daily planning features most people need without any subscription cost. You can even self-host it for complete privacy.

### Which AI scheduling tool is best for developers?

For developers, consider **Reclaim AI** with its Linear and Jira integrations for auto-scheduling development tasks, plus strong focus time protection. **Open Sunsama** is another good choice—it's free, open-source (you can contribute!), and has keyboard shortcuts and a command palette for fast operation. Motion works but lacks the developer-specific integrations.
