Daily planning is the cornerstone of productivity. It's not about cramming more into your day—it's about being intentional with the time you have. For a deeper dive, check out our [complete daily planning guide](/blog/complete-daily-planning-guide).

## The Philosophy of Daily Planning

Most productivity advice focuses on doing more. But true productivity is about doing the *right* things. Daily planning helps you:

- **Clarify priorities**: What actually matters today?
- **Manage energy**: When are you at your best?
- **Create boundaries**: What can wait until tomorrow?

## The Ideal Daily Planning Routine

### Morning Review (5-10 minutes)

Start each day with a brief planning session:

1. **Review your calendar**: What meetings and commitments do you have?
2. **Check your task list**: What's urgent? What's important?
3. **Set intentions**: Choose 1-3 "must do" tasks for the day
4. **Time block**: Assign specific times to your priorities

### Evening Shutdown (5 minutes)

End each day with a quick review:

1. **Celebrate wins**: What did you accomplish?
2. **Note incomplete items**: What needs to carry over?
3. **Prep for tomorrow**: Any early morning tasks to prepare for?
4. **Clear your mind**: Write down any lingering thoughts

## The Power of Constraints

Counterintuitively, constraints make planning easier:

### The 3-Task Rule

Choose no more than 3 "must do" tasks each day—these are your [daily goals](/blog/how-to-set-daily-goals). If you accomplish those three things, your day was successful—everything else is bonus.

### Energy Mapping

Not all hours are created equal. Map your energy patterns:

- **Peak hours**: Save for creative or challenging work
- **Trough hours**: Handle administrative tasks
- **Recovery hours**: Take breaks, go for walks

### Calendar Boundaries

Use [time blocking](/blog/what-is-time-blocking) to block time for:

- Deep work (no meetings allowed)
- Shallow work (email, admin)
- Personal time (lunch, exercise)

## Common Daily Planning Pitfalls

### Planning Too Much

Your day will never go exactly as planned. Leave margin for the unexpected. A 70% planned day gives you flexibility.

### Ignoring Energy Levels

Scheduling your hardest work when you're tired is a recipe for frustration. Know your rhythms and plan accordingly.

### Not Planning at All

"I'll figure it out as I go" sounds flexible but often leads to reactive, unfocused days. Even a rough plan beats no plan.

## Tools for Daily Planning

The best planning tool is one you'll actually use. Options include:

- **Paper planners**: Simple, tactile, no distractions
- **Digital calendars**: Shareable, searchable, adjustable
- **Hybrid approaches**: Paper for planning, digital for scheduling

Open Sunsama combines the best of both worlds—a visual, intuitive interface that feels as natural as pen and paper, but with the power of digital tools. The [kanban board](/features/kanban) makes task management intuitive.

## Building the Habit

Daily planning works best as a habit. Tips for making it stick:

1. **Same time, same place**: Create a ritual
2. **Start small**: Even 2 minutes of planning helps
3. **Stack it**: Attach planning to an existing habit (coffee, commute)
4. **Be patient**: Habits take 2-3 months to solidify
