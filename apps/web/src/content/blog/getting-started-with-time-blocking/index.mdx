Time blocking is a simple yet powerful technique for managing your day. Instead of keeping an endless to-do list, you assign specific blocks of time to each task—giving your day structure and focus. For a deeper exploration, see our [complete guide to time blocking](/blog/complete-guide-time-blocking).

## What is Time Blocking?

Time blocking is the practice of scheduling specific chunks of time for individual tasks or types of work. Rather than jumping between tasks reactively, you proactively decide when you'll work on what.

Think of your calendar as a container for your intentions. Each block represents a commitment to yourself about how you'll spend that time.

## Why Time Blocking Works

### 1. It Forces Prioritization

When you have limited calendar real estate, you're forced to make decisions about what truly matters. You can't fit 12 hours of work into an 8-hour day—time blocking makes that visible.

### 2. It Reduces Decision Fatigue

Once your day is planned, you don't have to constantly decide "what should I work on next?" Your calendar tells you. This preserves mental energy for the actual work.

### 3. It Creates Accountability

A scheduled block feels more like an appointment. You're less likely to skip "[deep work](/blog/deep-work-cal-newport-guide) from 9-11am" than you are to ignore a vague item on your to-do list.

## How to Start Time Blocking

Here's a practical approach to implementing time blocking:

### Step 1: Identify Your Tasks

Start by listing everything you need to accomplish. Don't filter—just dump everything onto the list.

### Step 2: Estimate Time

For each task, estimate how long it will take. Be honest—most of us underestimate. Add a 25% buffer to your estimates.

### Step 3: Block Your Calendar

Drag tasks onto your calendar, starting with your highest priorities. Consider your energy levels—put demanding work during your peak hours.

### Step 4: Protect Your Blocks

Treat time blocks as sacred. When someone requests a meeting during a blocked period, your default answer should be "I have a commitment then."

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Over-scheduling**: Leave buffer time between blocks. Unexpected things come up. A good rule is to schedule only 60-70% of your available time.

**Ignoring breaks**: Your brain needs rest. Block time for lunch, short walks, and transitions between tasks.

**Being too rigid**: Time blocking is a tool, not a cage. If something urgent comes up, adjust. The plan serves you, not the other way around. If you struggle with procrastination, see our guide on [using time blocking to stop procrastinating](/blog/stop-procrastinating-time-blocking).
