If you're searching for "Cron Calendar vs Sunsama," you've likely noticed that Cron no longer exists as an independent app. Notion acquired Cron in 2022, and the beloved calendar app has since been rebranded as Notion Calendar. But the original comparison question remains valid—users who loved Cron's speed and design now face a choice between Notion Calendar (Cron's successor) and Sunsama for their productivity needs.

Cron earned a cult following among developers and power users for its blazing-fast performance, keyboard-driven interface, and minimal aesthetic. Sunsama takes a fundamentally different approach—it's a daily planning methodology wrapped in software, asking "what deserves your time today?" rather than simply displaying your schedule. At $240/year, Sunsama bets that intentional planning is worth paying for.

This Cron Calendar vs Sunsama comparison examines both approaches: what made Cron special, how Notion Calendar carries that legacy forward, and when Sunsama's task-first philosophy makes more sense. We'll also introduce Open Sunsama—a free, open-source daily planner that combines calendar speed with comprehensive task management.

Now let's explore what made Cron special and how these tools compare for different workflows.

## What Was Cron Calendar?

Cron was an independent calendar application that launched in 2021 and quickly gained a devoted following among developers, designers, and productivity enthusiasts. Before Notion acquired it, Cron represented something rare in calendar software: an app built for speed, designed for keyboard power users, and stripped of unnecessary features.

### The Cron Philosophy

Cron's founding principle was that calendar apps had become bloated and slow. Google Calendar, while functional, felt sluggish. Outlook was enterprise-heavy. Apple Calendar lacked power-user features. Cron offered a third path: a calendar built from the ground up for speed and keyboard control.

The experience was distinctive:

- **Instant load times**: The app opened immediately with no loading spinners
- **Keyboard-first navigation**: Press "c" to create events, arrow keys to navigate, "t" for today
- **Minimal UI**: No clutter, no ads, no unnecessary chrome
- **Clean typography**: Thoughtful design that felt premium without being flashy

For users frustrated with slow calendar apps, Cron felt like a revelation.

### Why Power Users Loved Cron

Cron attracted a specific audience: people who create many calendar events, move them frequently, and value every second saved. Software developers scheduling standup meetings, designers blocking focus time, founders juggling investor calls—these users found Cron's speed advantage meaningful over dozens of daily interactions.

The keyboard shortcuts were particularly beloved. While other calendar apps required clicking through menus, Cron users could create, move, and delete events without touching their mouse. This efficiency compounds: saving 5 seconds per event across 20 daily calendar interactions adds up to minutes saved daily, hours weekly.

### The Notion Acquisition

In 2022, Notion acquired Cron. The goal was clear: Notion wanted a native calendar experience for its workspace platform. Rather than building calendar features from scratch, acquiring Cron brought proven technology and the team that built it.

The acquisition triggered mixed reactions. Cron users worried their beloved app would be absorbed into Notion's broader product strategy. Notion users excited about finally getting a proper calendar. The result, Notion Calendar, attempted to satisfy both audiences.

## What is Notion Calendar (Cron's Successor)?

Notion Calendar is what Cron became after Notion's acquisition. It retains Cron's speed and keyboard-driven design while adding deep Notion integration. Importantly, Notion Calendar is completely free—a strategic choice to draw users into Notion's ecosystem.

### How Notion Calendar Preserves Cron's Legacy

Many of Cron's beloved features survived the transition:

**Speed remains excellent**: Notion Calendar opens quickly and responds instantly to user actions. The engineering that made Cron fast wasn't sacrificed for new features.

**Keyboard shortcuts persist**: The power-user keyboard controls that defined Cron are still present. Press "c" for new events, navigate with arrow keys, and manage your calendar without leaving the keyboard.

**Clean design continues**: The minimal aesthetic that attracted Cron users remains. Notion Calendar isn't cluttered with promotional banners or unnecessary features.

**Multi-calendar support**: Connect Google Calendar, Outlook, and iCloud accounts. View everything unified or toggle specific calendars.

### What Notion Added

Beyond preserving Cron's core, Notion Calendar added features that leverage its parent company:

**Deep Notion Integration**: Link calendar events to Notion pages and databases. See database items with dates on your calendar. This bidirectional connection makes calendar events meaningful within your Notion workspace.

**Scheduling Links**: Create booking pages that let others schedule time with you—competing with Calendly and Cal.com.

**Time Zone Support**: Improved handling for remote teams working across time zones.

### Notion Calendar Limitations

Despite preserving much of Cron's appeal, Notion Calendar has limitations:

**No task management**: Notion Calendar is purely a calendar. Tasks must live in Notion databases—separate from the calendar app itself.

**No daily planning workflow**: Opening Notion Calendar shows your schedule but provides no guidance for planning your day intentionally.

**No focus mode**: When it's time to work, Notion Calendar offers no execution support—no timers, no Pomodoro, no distraction reduction.

**Ecosystem dependency**: The valuable Notion integration is meaningless if you don't use Notion. Non-Notion users get a nice free calendar but miss the key differentiator.

**Limited external integrations**: Beyond calendar providers and Notion, there's no connection to tools like Todoist, Asana, Linear, or Jira.

## What is Sunsama?

Sunsama approaches productivity from the opposite direction. Rather than building a faster calendar, Sunsama asks: "What if the problem isn't calendar speed, but lack of intentionality in how we plan our days?"

Sunsama is a daily planning application built on mindful productivity principles. At $240/year, it's positioned as a premium tool for knowledge workers who want to be more deliberate about their daily choices.

### The Sunsama Philosophy

Where Cron optimized for calendar efficiency, Sunsama optimizes for decision quality. The app doesn't assume you know what to work on—it guides you through deciding.

The core Sunsama experience is the morning planning ritual:

1. **Review your calendar**: See existing meetings and commitments
2. **Pull in tasks**: Import tasks from connected tools (Todoist, Asana, Notion, Linear, Jira, and more)
3. **Set daily intentions**: Consciously choose what you'll accomplish today
4. **Estimate time**: Add duration estimates to each task
5. **Time block your schedule**: Drag tasks onto specific calendar times
6. **Check capacity**: Sunsama warns if you've scheduled more than realistic

Throughout the day, focus mode helps you execute. At day's end, a shutdown ritual helps you reflect and roll incomplete tasks forward.

### Sunsama's Key Features

**Guided Daily Planning**: The morning ritual is Sunsama's philosophical foundation. You deliberately choose what matters rather than reactively working through endless task lists.

**Extensive Integrations**: Native two-way sync with Todoist, Trello, Asana, Notion, ClickUp, Jira, Linear, GitHub, Gmail, Slack, and more. Tasks flow from source systems into your daily plan; changes sync back.

**Focus Mode**: When working on a task, focus mode expands it to fill your screen with a timer running. Pomodoro support structures deep work sessions.

**Two-Way Calendar Sync**: Full bidirectional sync with Google Calendar, Outlook, and iCloud. Time blocks appear on your external calendar; events show in your planning view.

**Overplanning Prevention**: Sunsama tracks estimated durations and warns when you've scheduled more than can realistically be accomplished.

### Sunsama Pricing

Sunsama maintains premium positioning:

- **Monthly**: $25/month
- **Annual**: $20/month (billed as $240/year)
- **14-day free trial** (no credit card required)

There is no free tier. Compared to Notion Calendar's free pricing, Sunsama's cost requires significant value delivery to justify.

### Sunsama's Limitations

**No speed optimization**: Sunsama isn't slow, but it doesn't prioritize the blazing performance that defined Cron. Event creation involves forms rather than keyboard shortcuts.

**High price**: At $240/year versus Notion Calendar's $0, the cost difference is substantial.

**Learning curve**: The methodology takes time to adopt. Users expecting immediate gains may be disappointed during adjustment.

**No scheduling links**: Unlike Notion Calendar, Sunsama doesn't offer booking pages for external scheduling.

## Feature-by-Feature: Cron/Notion Calendar vs Sunsama

Let's compare these tools across capabilities that matter most.

### Speed and Performance

**Cron/Notion Calendar**: This was Cron's defining characteristic, and Notion Calendar preserves it. The app loads instantly, events create immediately, and navigation feels effortless. For users who interact with their calendar dozens of times daily, this speed compounds into meaningful time savings.

**Sunsama**: Adequate performance but not optimized for speed. Event creation uses traditional forms rather than keyboard shortcuts. The focus is planning quality over interaction speed.

**Verdict**: Notion Calendar wins decisively. If calendar speed was why you loved Cron, Notion Calendar maintains that advantage.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

**Cron/Notion Calendar**: Extensive keyboard controls inherited from Cron. Create events, navigate dates, switch views—all without touching your mouse. Power users can accomplish in seconds what takes others minutes.

**Sunsama**: Basic keyboard support exists but isn't central to the experience. The guided planning workflow assumes mouse/touch interaction.

**Verdict**: Notion Calendar wins for keyboard-driven users. The Cron DNA shows in every interaction.

### Task Management

**Cron/Notion Calendar**: No built-in task management. Tasks must live in Notion databases (if you use Notion) or external tools entirely separate from the calendar. The calendar and tasks exist in different apps with loose database-level connections.

**Sunsama**: Comprehensive task management with subtasks, notes, time estimates, and project organization. More importantly, tasks from dozens of external tools flow into one planning environment.

**Verdict**: Sunsama wins decisively. Notion Calendar assumes tasks live elsewhere; Sunsama makes task management central.

### Time Blocking

**Cron/Notion Calendar**: Possible through manual event creation. Create an event called "Deep work" from 9-11am. But there's no connection to task lists—calendar events and tasks are separate entities.

**Sunsama**: Drag tasks directly onto your calendar to create time blocks. The task populates the time block automatically. Change the task, the time block updates. This integration makes time blocking practical.

**Verdict**: Sunsama wins. The difference between manual events and integrated task-to-calendar blocking is significant for daily practice.

### Daily Planning Process

**Cron/Notion Calendar**: No planning methodology. Open the calendar, see your schedule, create events. What you work on is self-directed with no guidance.

**Sunsama**: Structured morning ritual walks you through reviewing commitments, pulling tasks, setting intentions, and time blocking. The app shapes your planning mindset.

**Verdict**: Sunsama wins for users who benefit from guided planning. Notion Calendar offers flexibility but zero methodology.

### Integrations

**Cron/Notion Calendar**: Limited to calendar providers (Google, Outlook, iCloud) and Notion itself. No native integration with Todoist, Asana, Linear, Jira, or other productivity tools.

**Sunsama**: Extensive integrations with 30+ tools including two-way sync. Tasks flow from source systems; changes sync back.

**Verdict**: Sunsama wins decisively if you use multiple productivity tools.

### Focus and Deep Work

**Cron/Notion Calendar**: No focus features. See your schedule, but execution support is absent.

**Sunsama**: Full focus mode with task expansion, Pomodoro timer, and minimal distraction interface.

**Verdict**: Sunsama wins. Focus mode is essential for knowledge workers who struggle with concentration.

## The Cron to Notion Calendar Transition

If you're a former Cron user evaluating options, understanding what changed matters:

### What Improved

- **Notion integration**: If you use Notion, the deep page-linking and database connections add genuine value
- **Scheduling links**: Built-in booking pages eliminate need for separate Calendly subscriptions
- **Long-term viability**: Notion's backing ensures continued development and support

### What Stayed the Same

- **Speed**: Still fast, still responsive
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Power-user controls remain
- **Clean design**: Minimal aesthetic preserved

### What Former Cron Users Miss

- **Independence**: Cron was a focused calendar app; Notion Calendar is part of a larger ecosystem
- **Privacy**: Some users preferred Cron before acquisition by a larger platform
- **Simplicity**: Notion integration adds complexity for non-Notion users

## When Calendar-First Works: Choose Notion Calendar

Notion Calendar (Cron's successor) makes sense if:

- **Speed is paramount**: You create and modify many events daily and value every second saved
- **You're a Notion user**: Deep workspace integration provides genuine value
- **Budget matters**: Free is hard to beat—especially for a polished, full-featured calendar
- **Keyboard efficiency matters**: You work faster with keyboard shortcuts than mouse navigation
- **You don't need planning methodology**: You naturally know what to work on; guidance feels restrictive
- **Tasks live in Notion already**: Your Notion databases serve as task management; you need calendar views

**Best for**: Cron loyalists who used Notion anyway, keyboard power users, budget-conscious professionals, and anyone who needs a faster alternative to Google Calendar.

## When Task-First Works: Choose Sunsama

Sunsama makes sense if:

- **You use multiple productivity tools**: Tasks live in Asana, Linear, Jira, email—you need unified planning regardless of source
- **Intentional planning resonates**: Guided morning rituals help you be deliberate about what deserves your time
- **Focus support matters**: Deep work requires execution help with timers and distraction reduction
- **You struggle with overcommitment**: You consistently schedule more than you can accomplish
- **Calendar speed isn't your bottleneck**: The problem isn't slow calendar interactions—it's lack of intentionality
- **$240/year is reasonable**: For a tool central to your productivity system

**Best for**: Knowledge workers juggling multiple project management systems, professionals who value methodology over flexibility, anyone who found fast calendars didn't solve their planning problems.

## Open Sunsama: Free Calendar Speed + Daily Planning

What if you want Cron's speed philosophy combined with Sunsama's planning methodology—but can't justify $240/year? What if you prefer open-source software with self-hosting options?

Open Sunsama is a free, open-source daily planner that combines fast calendar management with comprehensive task planning.

### Self-Hosting Option

For maximum privacy and control, run Open Sunsama on your own infrastructure. Your productivity data stays on servers you control.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What happened to Cron Calendar?

Notion acquired Cron in 2022 and rebranded it as Notion Calendar. The app retains Cron's speed, keyboard shortcuts, and minimal design while adding deep Notion integration. Notion Calendar is free, making it accessible to everyone, though the Notion integration is its key differentiator.

### Is Notion Calendar the same as Cron?

Essentially yes. Notion Calendar is Cron with added Notion integration and the Notion brand. The core experience—speed, keyboard shortcuts, clean design—remains from Cron. If you loved Cron, you'll recognize Notion Calendar immediately.

### Can I still download Cron?

No. Cron as an independent app no longer exists. Existing Cron users were migrated to Notion Calendar. New users can only download Notion Calendar from notion.so/product/calendar.

### Is there a Cron app alternative with the same speed?

Notion Calendar itself maintains Cron's speed. For alternatives outside the Notion ecosystem, **Open Sunsama** offers fast calendar integration with comprehensive task management. Other options include Fantastical (paid) and Morgen (freemium).

### Why do people still search for Cron Calendar vs Sunsama?

Many users discovered Cron before the Notion acquisition and associate the "Cron" name with fast, keyboard-driven calendar management. The comparison question reflects whether to prioritize calendar efficiency (what Cron offered) or intentional daily planning (what Sunsama offers).

### Is Sunsama worth $240/year over free Notion Calendar?

It depends on your needs. Sunsama's value comes from guided daily planning, extensive integrations beyond Notion, focus mode, and integrated task-to-calendar time blocking. If you benefit from methodology and use multiple productivity tools, the investment may pay off. If Notion Calendar meets your scheduling needs, the premium is harder to justify.

### Does Notion Calendar have task management?

Not directly. Notion Calendar displays Notion database items with dates, but task management happens in Notion's workspace, not the calendar app. For comprehensive task-calendar integration, tools like Sunsama or Open Sunsama are better suited.

### What's the best free alternative to both Cron and Sunsama?

**Open Sunsama** combines Cron's calendar-focused efficiency with Sunsama's task planning methodology—completely free. It offers time blocking, task management, focus mode with Pomodoro timer, and calendar sync at no cost, plus open-source transparency and self-hosting capability.

### Which is better for developers: Notion Calendar or Sunsama?

Developers who loved Cron often prefer **Notion Calendar** for its keyboard shortcuts and speed. However, developers using Linear, GitHub, and Jira may prefer **Sunsama** for its deep integrations with development tools. **Open Sunsama** offers a middle ground: fast calendar with task integration, completely free.

### Can I use Notion Calendar without Notion?

Yes, but you lose the key differentiator. Notion Calendar connects to Google, Outlook, and iCloud calendars and works as a standalone calendar app. However, the deep Notion integration—page linking, database views—requires Notion. Non-Notion users should evaluate whether the calendar alone justifies switching from their current app.

### Is Notion Calendar vs Sunsama the same comparison as Cron vs Sunsama?

Essentially yes. Since Cron became Notion Calendar, the comparison is the same: calendar-first efficiency versus task-first intentional planning. The main addition is Notion integration, which shifts the value proposition for Notion users.

### What keyboard shortcuts does Notion Calendar have from Cron?

Notion Calendar preserves Cron's extensive shortcuts: "c" to create events, arrow keys for navigation, "t" for today, "w" for week view, "d" for day view, and many more. The keyboard-first experience that defined Cron remains fully intact.

## Conclusion: Cron Calendar vs Sunsama—Which Approach Wins?

The Cron Calendar vs Sunsama question reflects a fundamental productivity philosophy choice:

**Choose Notion Calendar** if you valued Cron for its speed and simplicity. The Notion acquisition preserved what made Cron special—blazing performance, keyboard shortcuts, clean design—while adding useful Notion integration. At zero cost, it's the obvious choice for Notion users who need a better calendar experience and don't require guided planning methodology.

**Choose Sunsama** if calendar speed wasn't your real problem. If you're productive at scheduling but struggle with intentional daily choices, Sunsama's guided planning rituals and extensive integrations address that gap. At $240/year, it's an investment in methodology rather than just tooling—justified if you'll actually use the planning process.

**Choose Open Sunsama** if you want the best of both worlds without subscription costs. As the only free option that combines fast calendar integration with comprehensive task management, time blocking, and focus mode, Open Sunsama offers Cron's efficiency ethos with Sunsama's planning depth—open source, self-hostable, and completely free.

Cron is gone, but its legacy lives in Notion Calendar. Sunsama offers something Cron never tried to provide. And Open Sunsama proves you don't have to choose between speed and methodology—or pay $240/year to get both.
