Writers face a unique productivity challenge: the work itself is deeply creative, requiring extended periods of uninterrupted focus, yet the business of writing demands constant juggling—deadlines, multiple projects, research, revisions, submissions, and the endless administrative tasks that surround the creative core.

**Most productivity apps aren't built for writers.** They're designed for teams managing sprints, executives tracking KPIs, or project managers coordinating deliverables. The result? Writers end up with tools that interrupt their flow, fragment their attention, and make the already difficult task of sitting down to write even harder.

The best task management app for writers does something different. It protects deep work time, tracks writing-specific goals, manages deadlines across multiple projects, and—critically—gets out of the way when it's time to actually write.

In this guide, we'll compare the **best task management apps for writers in 2026**, examining what makes each tool suitable for the writer's unique workflow and helping you find the app that supports your writing life rather than complicating it.

## Why Writers Need Different Productivity Tools

Writing isn't like other knowledge work. Understanding why helps explain what writers need from their tools.

### The Deep Work Problem

Most modern work happens in short bursts—a 30-minute meeting, a quick email, a 15-minute call. Productivity apps optimize for this fragmented reality with notifications, quick actions, and task switching.

But writing requires the opposite. A single productive writing session might need 90 minutes or more of uninterrupted [deep work](/blog/deep-work-cal-newport-guide) to reach the state of flow where words come easily. Every notification, every task reminder, every distraction resets the clock.

**What writers need:** Apps that protect focus time, not interrupt it. [Time blocking](/blog/what-is-time-blocking) that reserves extended writing sessions. [Focus modes](/features/focus-mode) that hide everything except the current work.

### Multiple Projects with Different Timelines

Professional writers rarely work on one thing. A novelist might have:

- A manuscript draft due in six months
- An article due next week
- A newsletter going out tomorrow
- A book proposal awaiting feedback
- Several pitches in various stages

Each project has different timelines, different requirements, and different cognitive demands. Generic task managers treat all tasks equally—but "write 2,000 words on Chapter 7" is fundamentally different from "email editor about deadline extension."

**What writers need:** Project-aware systems that separate deep creative work from administrative tasks, with different handling for each.

### Word Count Goals and Writing Quotas

Writers measure progress differently. "Complete task" doesn't capture the work of writing—you might spend four hours writing and rewriting a single paragraph. The meaningful metric is often word count or time spent in focused writing.

**What writers need:** Apps that track writing-specific metrics like word count goals, daily writing quotas, and time spent in focused work.

### Deadline Pressure and Procrastination

Writers are famously prone to procrastination—not because they're lazy, but because creative work is hard to start. The blank page creates resistance. Deadlines feel abstract until they're imminent, and then panic sets in.

**What writers need:** Visual deadline tracking that makes due dates tangible, plus daily planning that breaks large projects into today's specific tasks.

### Research and Notes Integration

Writing requires extensive research, notes, and reference material. A task manager disconnected from your research creates friction—you have to switch contexts to find what you need.

**What writers need:** Apps that integrate task management with notes and writing, or at least don't create barriers between planning and execution.

## What to Look for in a Writer Task Management App

Based on the unique challenges writers face, the ideal writing schedule app includes:

### 1. Focus Mode or Deep Work Support

The ability to hide everything except your current task. No visible task list tempting you to switch. No notifications. Just the work in front of you.

### 2. Time Blocking for Writing Sessions

Visual time blocking that lets you reserve extended writing periods on your calendar. Seeing a 3-hour writing block makes the commitment concrete.

### 3. Project Organization

Separate spaces for different writing projects—manuscript, articles, pitches, admin—with the ability to focus on one project at a time.

### 4. Deadline Tracking

Clear visibility into what's due when, across all projects. Ideally with countdown views or timeline visualizations.

### 5. Progress Tracking

Word count goals, daily writing quotas, or time-based tracking for measuring writing output beyond simple task completion.

### 6. Minimal Distractions

Clean interface, optional notifications, and design that doesn't actively compete for your attention.

### 7. Quick Capture

The ability to capture tasks and ideas quickly without breaking focus—a floating capture window, keyboard shortcut, or quick-add feature.

### 8. Daily Planning Ritual

A workflow for reviewing what needs to happen today, so you can enter writing time knowing exactly what to work on.

Let's examine each app in detail for writer-specific use cases.

## 1. Open Sunsama – Free Daily Planning with Focus Mode

**Price: Free forever | Open source | Self-hostable**

Open Sunsama is a free, open-source daily planner built around visual time blocking and a powerful focus mode—exactly what writers need to protect their creative time. Unlike project management tools that overwhelm with features, Open Sunsama answers one question: **what are you writing today, and when?**

### Why Open Sunsama Works for Writers

**Focus Mode for Deep Work**: When you're ready to write, click into any task to enter focus mode. The entire screen shows only your current writing task—title, notes, subtasks, and a timer. The rest of your task list disappears. No visual reminders of other projects. No temptation to switch. Just you and the words.

**Visual Time Blocking**: Writers need extended blocks of uninterrupted time. Open Sunsama lets you drag writing tasks directly onto your calendar, creating visual commitments. A 3-hour morning writing block occupies 3 hours of visual space. You can see at a glance whether you've protected enough time for deep work or accidentally fragmented your day with meetings and admin tasks.

**Daily Planning View**: Each morning, Open Sunsama shows today's tasks alongside your calendar. You decide what you're writing today and when. This 5-minute morning ritual replaces vague intentions ("I should work on the manuscript") with concrete commitments ("Chapter 7 rewrite, 9am-12pm").

**Command Palette (Cmd+K)**: When an idea strikes—a new article topic, a research task, something to add to a manuscript—you need to capture it before it vanishes. The command palette lets you add tasks instantly without leaving what you're doing.

**Task Rollover**: Not every writing day goes according to plan. Sometimes the words don't come, or life interrupts. Open Sunsama doesn't punish you with accumulating guilt. Incomplete tasks roll over to tomorrow with a single action, giving you a fresh start.

**Project Organization**: Organize tasks by project—one for your novel, one for freelance articles, one for admin. Filter to see only one project at a time, keeping your focus narrow.

### The Writer's Workflow with Open Sunsama

1. **Morning Planning (5-10 minutes)**: Open the app, review any tasks that rolled over from yesterday. Decide what you're writing today. Drag your primary writing task to a 2-3 hour block when your mind is freshest. Schedule admin and shorter tasks around the writing time.

2. **Protect the Writing Block**: When your writing block arrives, enter focus mode. The timer starts. You write. If something comes up, capture it quickly in the inbox and return to writing.

3. **Single-Task Focus**: The focus mode eliminates the constant question of "what should I work on?" The answer is visible: this task, right now, for this amount of time.

4. **Track Progress with Time**: While Open Sunsama doesn't have built-in word count tracking, the timer shows how long you've spent writing. Over time, you learn how much focused time produces how many words.

5. **Flexible Rescheduling**: Writing doesn't always cooperate with schedules. Drag tasks to different times, move them to tomorrow, or adjust your plan based on reality. The system adapts without judgment.

### Why Free and Open Source Matters for Writers

Most writers aren't flush with cash. Subscription fatigue is real when you're paying for writing software, grammar checkers, research databases, and now task managers.

Open Sunsama is completely free:

- **No premium tier**: Focus mode, time blocking, all features available to everyone
- **No per-seat pricing**: Whether you're a solo writer or part of a writing group
- **Open source**: The code is public, so no surprise paywalls or manipulative design
- **Self-hostable**: Your writing plans and tasks stay yours

### Pricing

Free. No premium tier. No subscription. No feature limitations.

## 2. Sunsama – Guided Daily Planning Rituals

**Price: $20/month**

Sunsama is the premium inspiration for Open Sunsama—a daily planner with guided planning rituals, time blocking, and integrations with other productivity tools.

### Why Sunsama Works for Writers

**Guided Daily Planning**: Sunsama walks you through a daily planning ritual each morning. For writers who struggle with the discipline of daily planning, this external prompting ensures you start each day with a clear writing plan.

**Shutdown Ritual**: At day's end, Sunsama guides you through review and planning for tomorrow. This creates closure—important for writers who otherwise ruminate about unfinished work.

**Time Blocking**: Like Open Sunsama, tasks can be dragged to calendar time slots, creating visual writing blocks.

**Integrations**: If your writing tasks live in other tools—Asana, Trello, Notion—Sunsama can pull them into your daily plan.

### Limitations for Writers

- **Expensive**: At $20/month ($240/year), Sunsama costs more than many writers' entire software budget. This creates pressure to use it "correctly."
- **Guided rituals can feel heavy**: Some writers prefer to plan quickly and start writing. The guided process takes time.
- **Focus mode less immersive**: Sunsama has focus features, but they're not as comprehensive as Open Sunsama's dedicated focus mode.

### Who It's Best For

Writers who benefit from structured external guidance and have budget for premium tools. The daily planning ritual genuinely helps those who struggle to create their own routines.

## 3. Notion – Writing Hub with Task Management

**Price: Free (limited) | $10/month (Plus)**

Notion is a flexible workspace that can serve as a complete writing hub—notes, research, drafts, and task management in one place.

### Why Notion Works for Writers

**All-in-One Writing Hub**: Keep everything together—character notes, research, outlines, drafts, and task lists. No context switching between apps.

**Custom Writing Databases**: Create databases for tracking manuscripts, articles, pitches, or any writing project. Add properties for word count goals, deadlines, status, and more.

**Templates**: Build templates for your writing workflow—article templates, book chapter templates, query letter templates.

**Flexible Views**: See your writing projects as lists, kanban boards, calendars, or timelines depending on what you need.

### Limitations for Writers

- **Distraction risk**: Notion's flexibility is also its weakness. You can spend hours customizing instead of writing.
- **No dedicated focus mode**: While you can work in a single page, there's no immersive focus mode that hides everything else.
- **Time blocking requires manual setup**: No native calendar integration for time blocking your writing sessions.
- **Can become overwhelming**: As your Notion workspace grows, it can become its own project to maintain.

### Who It's Best For

Writers who want everything in one place and enjoy building systems. Works best for those who can resist the temptation to endlessly customize and actually use Notion for writing.

## 4. Scrivener – The Writer's Project Manager

**Price: $49 one-time (Mac/Windows)**

Scrivener is the classic long-form writing tool, designed specifically for novelists, screenwriters, and researchers working on complex projects.

### Why Scrivener Works for Writers

**Built for Long-Form**: Scrivener understands that a book isn't one document. It lets you break your manuscript into scenes, chapters, and acts that you can rearrange, view as outlines, or compile into a finished document.

**Composition Mode**: A full-screen, distraction-free writing mode that hides everything except your text. Customizable backgrounds, sounds, and typing modes.

**Word Count Goals**: Set project-wide word count targets and daily quotas. Scrivener tracks your progress and shows how much you need to write daily to hit your deadline.

**Research Binder**: Store research, notes, images, and reference PDFs alongside your manuscript.

**Compile**: When you're done, compile your manuscript into any format—PDF, Word, ePub, or screenplay format.

### Limitations for Writers

- **No time blocking or calendar**: Scrivener doesn't help you decide when to write—it helps you write once you're there.
- **No task management for non-writing tasks**: Admin, pitches, submissions, and other writing business need a separate tool.
- **Learning curve**: Scrivener is powerful but complex. New users often feel overwhelmed.
- **Desktop-only**: No web version, limited mobile support.

### Who It's Best For

Novelists and long-form writers working on single large projects. Scrivener excels at manuscript management but needs to be paired with another tool (like Open Sunsama) for planning when you'll write.

## 5. Todoist – Simple Task Capture for Writers

**Price: Free (limited) | $5/month (Pro)**

Todoist is the world's most popular task manager—fast, simple, and available everywhere.

### Why Todoist Works for Writers

**Lightning-Fast Capture**: When you're writing and an idea strikes—a new article topic, something to research, an email to send—Todoist's quick-add captures it instantly. Natural language input means typing "Research Victorian slang for Chapter 9 next Monday" creates a dated task automatically.

**Available Everywhere**: Web, desktop, mobile, browser extension, watch app. Wherever you are when a task occurs, Todoist is there.

**Project Organization**: Separate projects for different writing endeavors—Novel, Articles, Queries, Admin.

**Recurring Tasks**: "Write for 2 hours every weekday at 9am" becomes a recurring task that appears daily.

### Limitations for Writers

- **No time blocking**: Todoist is a list, not a calendar. It doesn't help you protect writing time.
- **No focus mode**: The full task list is always visible, tempting you to switch.
- **No writing-specific features**: No word count goals, no deadline countdowns, no deep work protection.
- **Can become a dumping ground**: Easy capture means easy accumulation. The inbox grows faster than you can process it.

### Who It's Best For

Writers who need reliable capture and simple organization. Todoist works best as a capture tool paired with a planning tool like Open Sunsama that provides time blocking and focus.

## 6. Bear – Elegant Notes with Lightweight Tasks

**Price: Free (basic) | $29.99/year (Pro)**

Bear is a beautiful note-taking app for Apple devices that blurs the line between notes and tasks.

### Why Bear Works for Writers

**Beautiful Writing Environment**: Bear's clean, elegant interface makes writing pleasant. Multiple themes, focused writing mode, and typography that respects the craft.

**Notes and Tasks Together**: Use markdown checkboxes for tasks within notes. Your research, drafts, and tasks live in the same place.

**Tagging System**: Organize everything with nested tags. #novel/chapter7 and #novel/research keep your project organized without rigid folders.

**Markdown Native**: Write in markdown that exports cleanly to any format.

### Limitations for Writers

- **Apple-only**: No Windows, Android, or web access.
- **Minimal task management**: Bear handles simple checkboxes but lacks due dates, time blocking, or project management.
- **No deadline tracking**: Tasks don't have dates or reminders.
- **Not a full task manager**: Bear is primarily a notes app with task features bolted on.

### Who It's Best For

Apple users who want a beautiful notes app with lightweight task checkboxes. Works well for writing drafts and capturing research, but needs a dedicated task manager for serious planning.

## 7. iA Writer – Distraction-Free Focused Writing

**Price: $49.99 one-time (Mac/Windows/iOS/Android)**

iA Writer is perhaps the most focused writing app ever made—deliberately minimal, obsessively polished, and designed for one thing: getting words on the page.

### Why iA Writer Works for Writers

**Pure Focus**: iA Writer's interface removes everything unnecessary. No formatting buttons, no sidebars, no distractions. Just your text on a clean background.

**Focus Mode**: Highlights the current sentence or paragraph while dimming everything else. Your attention stays on what you're writing right now.

**Reading Time and Word Count**: Built-in statistics show word count, character count, reading time, and more.

**Markdown with Preview**: Write in markdown, preview the formatted result. Export to anywhere.

**Content Blocks**: Pull in content from other files, letting you compose longer works from smaller pieces.

### Limitations for Writers

- **No task management**: iA Writer is purely for writing. It doesn't help you plan what to write or when.
- **No project management**: Each document is independent. No manuscript binder like Scrivener.
- **No deadlines or goals**: No target word counts or deadline tracking.
- **Requires separate planning tool**: You need another app to manage the tasks around your writing.

### Who It's Best For

Writers who want the most distraction-free writing experience possible. iA Writer is excellent for drafting but needs to be paired with a task manager like Open Sunsama for planning and scheduling.

## 8. Ulysses – Professional Writing Workflow

**Price: $49.99/year (Mac/iOS)**

Ulysses is a premium writing app for Apple users that combines beautiful writing with professional features for serious writers.

### Why Ulysses Works for Writers

**Library Organization**: All your writing lives in one library, organized with groups and filters. Manuscripts, articles, notes—everything is searchable and accessible.

**Writing Goals**: Set word count or character targets for individual documents or entire projects. Visual progress indicators show how close you are to your goal.

**Deadline Tracking**: Assign deadlines to sheets and see what's due when.

**iCloud Sync**: Seamless sync across Mac, iPad, and iPhone. Start writing on your laptop, continue on your phone.

**Publishing**: Publish directly to WordPress, Medium, or Ghost. Export to PDF, Word, ePub, or HTML.

### Limitations for Writers

- **Apple-only subscription**: Mac and iOS only, with annual subscription required.
- **No time blocking**: Ulysses doesn't integrate with your calendar for scheduling writing time.
- **No focus mode for task management**: While the writing interface is focused, there's no way to hide other projects while working.
- **Expensive for casual writers**: $50/year is significant if you're not writing professionally.

### Who It's Best For

Professional writers committed to the Apple ecosystem who want writing goals, deadline tracking, and beautiful organization in one app. Still benefits from pairing with a daily planner like Open Sunsama for time blocking.

## Time Blocking for Writing Projects

Time blocking is the practice of reserving specific calendar blocks for specific work. For writers, this is transformative.

### Why Time Blocking Works for Writers

**Writing competes with everything else.** Without a reserved block, writing loses to emails, meetings, admin tasks, and the general noise of life. Time blocking gives writing a protected slot that other tasks can't invade.

**It makes the commitment visible.** "I'll write sometime this morning" is vague and easily broken. "I'm writing from 9-12" is a concrete appointment with yourself.

**It limits context switching.** When you're in your writing block, you're not deciding whether to write—that decision was made when you scheduled the block. You just write.

### How to Time Block as a Writer

1. **Identify your peak creative hours.** Most writers have 2-4 hours when their mind is sharpest for creative work. Protect this time religiously.

2. **Schedule writing first.** Don't let admin tasks fill your calendar before you've blocked writing time. Open your planner, block your writing time, then schedule everything else around it.

3. **Make blocks long enough.** Creative work takes time to start. A 30-minute writing block barely reaches flow before it ends. Aim for 90 minutes minimum, 3 hours ideal.

4. **Include setup and wind-down.** A 9-12 writing block might mean 9-9:15 for setup (tea, music, closing tabs), 9:15-11:45 for writing, and 11:45-12 for saving and noting where you left off.

5. **Protect the blocks fiercely.** Writing blocks are not tentative. They're appointments. If someone wants to schedule a meeting during your writing time, the answer is: "I'm not available then."

### Time Blocking with Open Sunsama

Open Sunsama makes time blocking natural:

1. Create a task: "Write Chapter 7 - Scene with antagonist"
2. Drag it to your calendar at 9am
3. Resize the block to 3 hours
4. When 9am arrives, click the task to enter focus mode
5. The timer tracks your writing time automatically

## Building a Sustainable Writing Routine

The best task management app is only useful if you use it consistently. Here's how to build a writing routine that sticks.

### 1. Start with Minimum Viable Writing

Don't commit to writing 3,000 words daily. Start with something so small it's almost embarrassing:

- Write for 15 minutes
- Write 200 words
- Open your document and write one paragraph

The goal is building the habit of daily writing. Volume comes later.

### 2. Same Time, Same Place

Your brain learns to enter writing mode when cues are consistent. Write at the same time in the same place using the same tools. Over time, sitting at your desk at 9am triggers the writing mindset automatically.

### 3. Plan Tomorrow Tonight

Before bed or at the end of your workday, spend 5 minutes planning tomorrow's writing. What will you work on? When? What do you need to do it?

When tomorrow arrives, the decision is already made. You just execute.

### 4. Separate Planning from Writing

Don't plan what to write during your writing block—that's a different cognitive mode. Plan during your evening review or morning ritual. When the writing block starts, you should already know exactly what you're working on.

### 5. Track the Streak, Not the Output

Some writing days produce 3,000 words. Some produce 300. Both count as writing days. Track your streak of consecutive writing days rather than daily word counts. The consistency matters more than any single day's output.

### 6. Use Focus Mode Religiously

When it's time to write, enter focus mode. Hide your task list, close your email, silence notifications. The writing block is sacred space.

### 7. End with a Breadcrumb

When you stop writing, leave yourself a note about what comes next. "Continue with dialogue where Elena discovers the letter" gives tomorrow-you a clear starting point, reducing the activation energy to begin.

### 8. Forgive Bad Days

Not every writing session is productive. Sometimes the words won't come. Sometimes life intervenes. The important thing is returning tomorrow. A sustainable routine survives bad days without collapsing.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the best task management app for writers?

**Open Sunsama** is our top recommendation for writers because it combines visual time blocking (essential for protecting deep work time), a powerful focus mode (for single-task immersion), and daily planning structure—all for free. Writers need extended uninterrupted focus to enter flow state, and Open Sunsama's design specifically supports this. For writers wanting writing-specific features like word count goals, pairing Open Sunsama with a dedicated writing app like Scrivener or Ulysses creates a complete workflow.

### What do professional writers use to manage their work?

Professional writers typically use a combination of tools: a dedicated writing app (Scrivener, Ulysses, or iA Writer), a task manager for planning (Open Sunsama, Todoist, or Notion), and sometimes a separate tool for research (Notion, DEVONthink, or Zotero). The most important factor isn't the specific tool but the system—professional writers protect their writing time, plan their days intentionally, and track progress toward deadlines.

### How do I track word count goals with a task manager?

While most task managers don't have built-in word count tracking, you can work around this by:
1. Including word count targets in task names ("Write 2,000 words - Chapter 7")
2. Using time-based goals instead ("Write for 2 hours - Chapter 7")
3. Tracking word counts in a separate writing app (Scrivener, Ulysses) and using your task manager for scheduling
4. Creating a simple spreadsheet that tracks daily word counts alongside your task manager

### What's the best free task management app for writers?

**Open Sunsama** is completely free with no premium tier or feature limitations. It includes visual time blocking, focus mode, daily planning, and quick capture—features that typically require paid subscriptions in other apps. Todoist and Notion also offer useful free tiers, though Todoist lacks time blocking and focus features, while Notion requires significant setup to become a functional task manager.

### How do I protect my writing time from distractions?

Use apps with dedicated focus modes that hide everything except your current task. **Open Sunsama's focus mode** shows only your current task with a timer, eliminating visual distractions. Additionally:
- Schedule writing during your peak creative hours
- Time block your writing sessions so they appear as appointments
- Turn off notifications during writing blocks
- Consider website blockers like Freedom or Cold Turkey for persistent distractions
- Work in a dedicated writing location when possible

### Should writers use project management apps like Asana or Monday?

Generally, no. Project management apps are designed for teams coordinating complex workflows with dependencies, assignments, and approvals. Writers typically work solo on creative tasks that don't fit this model. The overhead of project management features creates friction without providing value. Writers are better served by daily planners (Open Sunsama, Sunsama), simple task managers (Todoist), or writing-specific tools (Scrivener, Ulysses).

### How do I manage multiple writing projects at once?

Organize each project separately—whether as tags, projects, or folders in your task manager. Then focus on one project at a time during each writing session. The key is:
1. Keep each project's tasks separate and organized
2. Use your daily planning ritual to decide which project gets today's writing time
3. Don't switch projects within a single writing block
4. Time block different projects on different days when possible

(For freelance writers managing client work, see also [best task management apps for freelancers](/blog/best-task-management-apps-freelancers).)

### What's the best writing app with task management built in?

**Ulysses** comes closest with its built-in deadlines and writing goals, though it's Apple-only and subscription-based. **Notion** can be configured as an all-in-one writing and task management hub, though it lacks dedicated focus features. For most writers, the best approach is pairing a focused writing app (iA Writer, Scrivener) with a dedicated task manager (Open Sunsama) rather than seeking a single tool that does everything.

### How often should writers plan their tasks?

Daily planning is most effective for writers. Each morning (or the night before), spend 5-10 minutes:
1. Reviewing yesterday's progress
2. Deciding what to write today
3. Time blocking your writing session
4. Scheduling necessary admin tasks around the writing

Weekly planning is also valuable for reviewing deadlines, adjusting project timelines, and ensuring you're making progress on longer-term goals.

## Conclusion: Open Sunsama for Distraction-Free Writing

Writers need different tools than most knowledge workers. The creative demands of writing require extended deep focus, while the business of writing demands juggling deadlines, projects, and endless administrative tasks.
