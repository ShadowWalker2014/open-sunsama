Three premium daily planners dominate the productivity tool market in 2026: Akiflow, Sunsama, and Motion. Each costs $180-290 per year. Each promises to transform how you manage your time. But they take fundamentally different approaches—and choosing the wrong one means paying for features that don't match how you work.

Akiflow is the keyboard-first power user's dream with its universal inbox. Sunsama guides you through mindful daily rituals. Motion lets AI schedule your entire day automatically. The question isn't which tool is "best"—it's which philosophy matches your brain.

In this comprehensive Akiflow vs Sunsama comparison, we'll break down exactly what makes each tool unique, compare their pricing and features, and help you decide which daily planner deserves your subscription dollars. We'll also introduce Open Sunsama, a free alternative that offers the core planning features without the premium price tag.

Now let's examine each tool in detail to find the best daily planner for your needs.

## What is Akiflow?

Akiflow is a time-blocking productivity app built for power users who value speed above all else. Founded in 2020 by a team frustrated with slow, mouse-dependent planning tools, Akiflow positions itself as the fastest way to capture, organize, and schedule your work.

### How Akiflow Works

Akiflow's killer feature is its **universal inbox**—a single place where tasks from all your tools automatically appear. Emails, Slack messages, Asana tasks, Notion pages, Trello cards, GitHub issues—everything flows into one inbox without you lifting a finger.

From there, Akiflow is keyboard-first. Press a key to create a task. Press another to schedule it. Press another to time-block it on your calendar. Power users report processing their entire inbox in minutes, something that would take far longer in mouse-dependent tools.

The philosophy is efficiency: capture everything fast, decide later, schedule with precision.

### Akiflow Key Features

**Universal Inbox**: The flagship feature. Tasks from 20+ integrations automatically appear in a single inbox. No more checking multiple apps for what needs doing. Gmail emails, Slack messages, Linear issues, Todoist tasks—all in one place.

**Command Bar**: Press Cmd+K (or Ctrl+K) to access any action. Create tasks, jump between views, trigger integrations, adjust settings—all without touching your mouse.

**Keyboard-First Design**: Nearly every action has a keyboard shortcut. Veterans can process hundreds of tasks without leaving the home row.

**Time Blocking**: Drag tasks to your calendar or use keyboard shortcuts to schedule time blocks. Integrates bi-directionally with Google Calendar and Outlook.

**Recurring Tasks**: Set up repeating tasks with flexible scheduling—daily, weekly, monthly, or custom patterns.

**Availability Sharing**: Share your available time slots with others, similar to Calendly but built into your planner.

**Mobile App**: iOS and Android apps for capturing tasks on the go.

### Akiflow Pricing in 2026

Akiflow offers two pricing tiers with no free option:

| Plan | Price (Annual) | Price (Monthly) |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| **Plus** | $14.99/month ($180/year) | $24.99/month |
| **Teams** | $24.99/month | Contact sales |

A 7-day free trial is available. The Plus plan includes all features for individual users. Teams adds shared workspaces, team calendars, and admin controls.

### Akiflow Limitations

**No Focus Mode**: Akiflow helps you plan work but doesn't help you *do* the work. No built-in timer, no distraction hiding, no deep focus features.

**Learning Curve**: The keyboard-first approach is powerful but intimidating. It takes time to memorize shortcuts and build muscle memory.

**No AI Features**: Unlike Motion, Akiflow doesn't auto-schedule or suggest optimal times. You make every decision manually.

**Expensive for Some**: At $180/year, Akiflow costs more than many alternatives for what's primarily a capture and scheduling tool.

**Individual Focus**: While Teams exists, Akiflow is built primarily for solo productivity. Limited collaboration features compared to Motion.

## What is Sunsama?

Sunsama is a daily planner built around mindfulness and intentional work. Rather than optimizing for speed like Akiflow or automation like Motion, Sunsama emphasizes conscious decisions about how you spend your time. The app includes guided rituals for both starting and ending your day.

### How Sunsama Works

Sunsama's approach is deliberately slow—in a good way. Each morning, the app walks you through a **daily planning ritual**. You review your calendar, pull in tasks from connected tools, and consciously choose what deserves your time today. If you schedule more than 6-8 hours of work, Sunsama warns you that you're overplanning.

During the day, you manually drag tasks onto your calendar as time blocks. When a task is active, you can expand it into **focus mode**—filling your screen with just that task and a timer.

At day's end, a **shutdown ritual** helps you reflect on what you accomplished and consciously decide what rolls forward to tomorrow.

### Sunsama Key Features

**Daily Planning Ritual**: Guided morning sessions that set realistic daily goals. This isn't overhead—it's the core practice that makes Sunsama different.

**Focus Mode**: Expand any task to fill your screen, start a timer, and hide distractions. Includes Pomodoro support and session tracking.

**Extensive Integrations**: Two-way sync with Todoist, Trello, Asana, Notion, ClickUp, Jira, Linear, GitHub, Gmail, Slack, and more. Best-in-class for pulling tasks from multiple sources.

**Overplanning Warnings**: The app tracks estimated time and alerts when you've scheduled more than realistic for a human workday.

**Calm Interface**: Deliberately minimal design. No gamification, no streaks, no pressure—just focused planning.

**Shutdown Ritual**: Evening reflection on what you accomplished, what got skipped, and what moves to tomorrow.

**Timeboxing**: Built-in support for scheduling specific durations for each task, with visual progress tracking.

### Sunsama Pricing in 2026

Sunsama recently raised prices after years at $20/month:

| Plan | Price |
|------|-------|
| **Monthly** | $25/month |
| **Annual** | $20/month ($240/year) |

A 14-day free trial is available, no credit card required. There's no free tier—Sunsama is premium-only.

### Sunsama Limitations

**No Universal Inbox**: Unlike Akiflow, tasks don't automatically flow in. You pull them during planning rituals or manually add them.

**No AI Automation**: Everything is manual. If you want software to schedule your day, look elsewhere.

**Limited Keyboard Shortcuts**: While shortcuts exist, Sunsama is more mouse-driven than Akiflow. Power users may feel slower.

**Individual Focus Only**: No team features, shared projects, or collaboration tools. It's built for personal productivity.

**Premium Price**: At $240/year with no free tier, Sunsama is a significant investment for what's essentially a manual planner.

## What is Motion?

Motion is an AI-powered scheduling app that automatically plans your entire day. When you add tasks with deadlines and durations, Motion's algorithm finds the optimal time slots and creates your schedule. It's the most automated option in this comparison—and the most divisive.

### How Motion Works

Motion takes full control of your schedule. You input tasks, set deadlines, and estimate how long each will take. Motion's AI then decides when you'll work on each task, considering your meetings, priorities, energy patterns, and working hours.

If something changes—a meeting runs long, a new urgent task appears, a deadline shifts—Motion automatically reschedules everything. Your job is simply to follow the schedule and mark tasks complete.

This appeals to people who hate planning. Rather than spending 15-20 minutes each morning deciding what to work on, Motion decides for you.

### Motion Key Features

**AI Auto-Scheduling**: The flagship feature. Add any task, and Motion finds the best time slot based on deadlines, priorities, calendar events, and your preferences.

**Dynamic Rescheduling**: When something changes—cancelled meeting, new urgent task, missed deadline—Motion adjusts your entire day automatically.

**Project Management**: Unlike Akiflow and Sunsama, Motion includes project management features. Kanban boards, task dependencies, and team workspaces.

**Meeting Scheduler**: Built-in scheduling links for booking meetings, similar to Calendly but integrated with your task schedule.

**Productivity Analytics**: Business tier includes dashboards showing time allocation, task completion rates, and productivity trends.

**Team Features**: Shared projects, automatic workload balancing, and team capacity planning.

### Motion Pricing in 2026

Motion is the most expensive option with no free tier:

| Plan | Price (Annual) | Price (Monthly) |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| **Pro AI** | $19/month ($228/year) | $34/month |
| **Business AI** | $29/month ($348/year) | Contact sales |

A 7-day free trial is available. Motion's pricing reflects its ambition to replace both your calendar and task manager.

### Motion Limitations

**Loss of Control**: Some people find AI-scheduled days disorienting. When the algorithm reschedules your afternoon without asking, it can feel like you've lost agency.

**No Focus Mode**: Motion optimizes your schedule but doesn't help you actually focus during work periods. No timer, no distraction hiding.

**Limited Integrations**: Motion has fewer integrations than Akiflow or Sunsama. No native Notion, Trello, or GitHub connections—you need Zapier workarounds.

**Expensive**: At $228-408/year, Motion costs more than any alternative in this comparison.

**Overkill for Simple Needs**: If you have a straightforward schedule and don't need project management, Motion's complexity may be more than you need.

## Akiflow vs Sunsama vs Motion: Feature Deep Dive

Let's compare these three premium planners across the features that matter most.

### Keyboard Shortcuts and Speed

**Akiflow**: The clear winner. Everything has a shortcut. Cmd+N for new task, Cmd+T for today, Cmd+Enter to schedule. Power users can process their entire inbox without touching the mouse.

**Sunsama**: Basic shortcuts exist but the interface is designed around drag-and-drop. Planning rituals require mouse interaction. Slower for keyboard enthusiasts.

**Motion**: Minimal shortcuts. The philosophy is that AI should do the work—you shouldn't need to be fast at scheduling because Motion handles it.

**Verdict**: Akiflow wins decisively for speed and keyboard operation.

### Calendar Integration

**Akiflow**: Bi-directional sync with Google Calendar and Outlook. Tasks become calendar events; calendar events inform available time. Multiple calendar support.

**Sunsama**: Similar bi-directional sync with Google Calendar, Outlook, and iCloud Calendar. Events appear alongside tasks during planning.

**Motion**: Full calendar sync plus AI awareness. Motion reads your calendar to find available slots and schedules around existing events.

**Verdict**: Tie. All three offer solid calendar integration with different approaches.

### Task Capture

**Akiflow**: Universal inbox is the killer feature. Tasks automatically flow in from 20+ integrations—Gmail, Slack, Notion, Linear, GitHub, Asana, Todoist, Trello, and more.

**Sunsama**: Pull-based model. During planning rituals, you actively pull tasks from connected integrations. Good integration coverage but requires manual action.

**Motion**: Basic task creation. Most tasks are added manually or through basic integrations. No universal inbox concept.

**Verdict**: Akiflow wins with its universal inbox approach.

### AI Features

**Akiflow**: None. Everything is manual—you decide what to work on and when.

**Sunsama**: None. The philosophy is intentional human decision-making, not AI automation.

**Motion**: Full AI scheduling. The algorithm decides your entire day based on deadlines, priorities, and calendar availability.

**Verdict**: Motion is the only option for AI automation. Whether that's good depends on your preferences.

### Integrations

**Akiflow**: 20+ integrations including Gmail, Slack, Notion, Linear, GitHub, Asana, Todoist, Trello, ClickUp, Jira, and more. Universal inbox makes integrations especially powerful.

**Sunsama**: 15+ integrations including Todoist, Trello, Asana, Notion, ClickUp, Jira, Linear, GitHub, Gmail, and Slack. Excellent coverage for pulling tasks.

**Motion**: Limited integrations. Calendar sync with Google and Outlook, plus basic Zoom integration. Most connections require Zapier.

**Verdict**: Akiflow and Sunsama tie for integration depth; Motion lags significantly.

## Pricing Comparison: What Does Your Daily Planner Actually Cost?

All three premium planners require significant annual investment:

| Tool | Annual Cost | Monthly Cost | Free Tier |
|------|-------------|--------------|-----------|
| Akiflow | $180/year | $300/year | No |
| Sunsama | $240/year | $300/year | No |
| Motion | $228/year | $408/year | No |
| Open Sunsama | $0 | $0 | Yes—everything free |

**Cost Analysis**:
- **Most affordable**: Akiflow at $180/year (annual billing)
- **Most expensive**: Motion at $228-408/year depending on billing
- **Middle ground**: Sunsama at $240/year

Over 3 years, you'd spend $540-720 on Akiflow, $720 on Sunsama, or $684-1,224 on Motion. That's real money for a productivity tool.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Akiflow better than Sunsama for daily planning?

**Akiflow** is better if you prioritize speed, keyboard shortcuts, and automatic task capture from multiple tools via its universal inbox. **Sunsama** is better if you value mindful planning rituals, focus mode, and structured daily routines. Akiflow is for power users who process quickly; Sunsama is for intentional workers who plan thoughtfully.

### What is the best Akiflow alternative in 2026?

The best Akiflow alternative depends on your priorities. **Sunsama** is ideal if you want mindful planning rituals instead of speed. **Motion** is best if you want AI to auto-schedule your day. **Open Sunsama** is the best free alternative with time blocking, focus mode, and keyboard shortcuts without the $180/year cost.

### Is Motion worth the price compared to Akiflow?

Motion costs more ($228/year vs $180/year) and offers a fundamentally different experience. Motion automatically schedules your entire day using AI—you add tasks and it decides when you work on them. Akiflow gives you full manual control with speed and keyboard shortcuts. Motion is worth it if you want complete automation; Akiflow is better if you want control with efficiency.

### Can Akiflow or Sunsama replace Motion's AI scheduling?

No. Neither Akiflow nor Sunsama offers automatic scheduling. Both are manual planners where you decide when to work on each task. If you specifically want AI to create your daily schedule, Motion is the only option among these three. However, many users prefer manual control—the "best" approach depends on your working style.

### Which daily planner has the best integrations?

**Akiflow** has the best integrations for task capture with its universal inbox—tasks automatically flow in from 20+ apps. **Sunsama** has excellent integrations for pulling tasks during planning rituals. **Motion** has limited integrations and often requires Zapier workarounds. For integration depth, Akiflow and Sunsama are clearly superior.

### Is there a free alternative to Akiflow and Sunsama?

Yes. **Open Sunsama** is a free, open-source daily planner with time blocking, focus mode, command palette, and calendar sync. While it doesn't have Akiflow's universal inbox or Sunsama's guided rituals, it provides core planning features without the $180-240/year subscription cost.

### What is the best daily planner app in 2026?

The best daily planner depends on your workflow. **Akiflow** is best for keyboard-first power users who need speed and universal task capture. **Sunsama** is best for mindful planners who value rituals and sustainable work. **Motion** is best for those who want AI to schedule everything automatically. **Open Sunsama** is best for budget-conscious users who want free, open-source planning.

### How do Akiflow vs Motion compare for busy professionals?

**Akiflow** gives busy professionals a fast way to capture and organize tasks from multiple sources, with manual scheduling control. **Motion** removes decision-making entirely by having AI schedule your day automatically. Akiflow is better if you want to stay in control; Motion is better if you want the algorithm to handle complexity.

### Does Sunsama have a universal inbox like Akiflow?

No. Sunsama uses a pull-based model where you actively retrieve tasks from connected tools during planning rituals. Akiflow's universal inbox automatically captures tasks in the background. If automatic task capture is essential, Akiflow is the better choice. If you prefer intentional, ritual-based planning, Sunsama's approach may actually be preferable.

**How do you want to capture tasks?**
