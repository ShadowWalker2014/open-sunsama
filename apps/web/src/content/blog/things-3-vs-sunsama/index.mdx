Things 3 and Sunsama represent two fundamentally different philosophies of task management. One offers GTD elegance in a beautifully crafted Apple-native experience. The other guides you through daily planning rituals with calendar-first workflows. Both have passionate followings among Mac users—but they solve different problems.

Things 3 is a Getting Things Done (GTD) task manager built exclusively for Apple devices. It's won multiple Apple Design Awards, costs $50 one-time for Mac (plus separate purchases for iPhone and iPad), and has remained the gold standard for GTD practitioners since its 2017 release. No subscriptions, no bloat—just elegant task management.

Sunsama takes the opposite approach. Rather than organizing tasks in GTD hierarchies, it focuses on *today*—what will you actually accomplish in the next eight hours? It syncs with your calendar, pulls tasks from dozens of integrations, and guides you through mindful daily planning. At $240/year, it's a premium subscription aimed at knowledge workers seeking sustainable productivity.

In this comprehensive Things 3 vs Sunsama comparison, we'll examine both approaches in detail: features, pricing models, calendar integration, and ideal use cases. We'll also introduce Open Sunsama—a free, open-source alternative that offers calendar-first daily planning without the premium price tag.

Now let's examine each task manager in detail.

## What is Things 3?

Things 3 is a GTD-inspired task manager created by Cultured Code, a small German development studio. Released in 2017, it's widely considered one of the most beautifully designed productivity apps ever made. It won Apple Design Awards in 2017 and continues to be featured as a best-in-class Mac app.

### How Things 3 Works

Things 3 organizes tasks using GTD principles adapted for modern workflows:

1. **Inbox**: Capture everything quickly—tasks go here first
2. **Today**: What you've committed to doing today
3. **Upcoming**: Tasks scheduled for specific dates
4. **Anytime**: Tasks without deadlines, available when you have time
5. **Someday**: Tasks you might do eventually
6. **Projects**: Multi-step outcomes organized with headers and checklists
7. **Areas**: Life categories that contain projects (Work, Personal, Health, etc.)

The workflow is elegant: capture tasks in the Inbox, then organize them into Projects within Areas. Schedule tasks for specific dates or leave them in Anytime. Each morning, review what's in Today and get to work.

### Things 3 Key Features

**GTD-Native Design**: Unlike apps that bolt GTD onto generic task lists, Things 3 was built around GTD principles. The Today view, Someday list, and project organization reflect GTD's workflow naturally.

**Beautiful Apple-Native Interface**: Things 3 is genuinely stunning. Every animation is smooth, every interaction feels intentional. The attention to detail is remarkable—even the way tasks check off feels satisfying. This isn't superficial; good design reduces cognitive load.

**Headings in Projects**: Organize complex projects with section headings. A project like "Launch Product" can have headings for Research, Development, Marketing, and Launch with tasks under each.

**Quick Entry**: Global keyboard shortcuts let you capture tasks instantly from any app. Press a hotkey, type your task, and return to what you were doing.

**Natural Language Dates**: Type "tomorrow" or "next Tuesday" when entering tasks—Things 3 understands and schedules accordingly.

**Markdown Support**: Task notes support Markdown formatting for rich documentation within tasks.

**Repeating Tasks**: Flexible recurring task options cover daily, weekly, monthly, and custom patterns.

**Apple Ecosystem Integration**: Siri Shortcuts, Apple Watch app, iOS widgets, and seamless iCloud sync across Apple devices. The integration depth is exceptional.

### Things 3 Pricing in 2026

Things 3 uses a one-time purchase model—increasingly rare in the subscription economy:

- **Mac**: $49.99 (one-time)
- **iPhone/Apple Watch**: $9.99 (one-time)
- **iPad**: $19.99 (one-time)
- **Full Bundle**: ~$80 total (one-time)

No subscription, no yearly fees. You pay once and own the software. Major upgrades (like Things 4, whenever it arrives) would be separate purchases, but Things 3 has been actively maintained since 2017 without requiring additional payment.

### Things 3 Limitations

**No Calendar Integration**: This is Things 3's most significant gap for daily planners. You can *view* your calendar events within Things 3, but there's no two-way sync. Tasks don't become calendar blocks. You can't drag tasks onto specific times. For [time blocking](/blog/what-is-time-blocking) workflows, this is a dealbreaker.

**Apple-Only Ecosystem**: Things 3 runs only on Mac, iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. No Windows, no Android, no web app, no Linux. If you use any non-Apple device—even occasionally—Things 3 can't be your primary task manager.

**No Integrations**: Things 3 doesn't integrate with Todoist, Asana, Trello, Notion, Jira, Linear, Gmail, Slack, or any external tools. Tasks live in Things 3 and nowhere else. You can't pull in work from project management systems.

**No Time Blocking**: Related to the calendar limitation—Things 3 doesn't support scheduling tasks at specific times with durations. You know *what* you'll do today, but not *when* you'll do it.

**No Collaboration**: Things 3 is purely individual. No shared projects, no task delegation, no team visibility. This is intentional—it's a personal productivity tool—but limits professional use.

**No Focus Mode**: Despite being a productivity app, Things 3 doesn't include dedicated focus or deep work features. No timers, no distraction blocking, no Pomodoro support.

## What is Sunsama?

Sunsama is a daily planner built around mindful, intentional productivity. Rather than organizing all your tasks in GTD hierarchies, Sunsama focuses on one question: what will you realistically accomplish today? It's designed for knowledge workers who want to integrate task management with calendar management.

### How Sunsama Works

Sunsama's core experience is the daily planning ritual:

1. **Review your calendar**: See today's meetings and commitments
2. **Pull in tasks**: Import tasks from connected tools (Asana, Trello, Notion, Linear, etc.)
3. **Set daily intentions**: Consciously decide what deserves your time today
4. **Time block your schedule**: Drag tasks onto specific calendar times
5. **Check capacity**: Sunsama warns if you've over-scheduled

Throughout the day, you work through time blocks, using focus mode to concentrate on individual tasks. At day's end, an optional shutdown ritual helps you reflect and roll incomplete tasks forward.

### Sunsama Key Features

**Guided Daily Planning**: The morning ritual isn't optional—it's Sunsama's philosophy made tangible. You consciously choose what deserves your time rather than reactively working through endless task lists.

**Full Calendar Integration**: Two-way sync with Google Calendar, Outlook, and iCloud. Tasks become calendar blocks. Changes flow both directions. This is the feature Things 3 lacks and many users want.

**Time Blocking**: Drag tasks from your list onto specific calendar times. Each task becomes a scheduled block with start time and duration. See exactly when you'll work on what.

**Extensive Integrations**: Native two-way sync with Todoist, Trello, Asana, Notion, ClickUp, Jira, Linear, GitHub, Gmail, Slack, and more. Pull tasks from wherever they originate.

**Focus Mode**: When working on a task, [focus mode](/features/focus-mode) expands it to fill your screen, starts a timer, and minimizes distractions. Pomodoro timer support structures deep work sessions.

**Overplanning Prevention**: Sunsama tracks estimated durations and warns when you've scheduled more than is realistic—promoting sustainable productivity rather than burnout.

**Cross-Platform Access**: Works on web, Mac, and Windows. While mobile apps exist, the desktop experience is primary.

### Sunsama Pricing in 2026

Sunsama uses subscription pricing:

- **Monthly**: $25/month
- **Annual**: $20/month (billed as $240/year)
- **14-day free trial** (no credit card required)

There's no free tier. Sunsama's pricing positions it as a professional tool for serious knowledge workers.

### Sunsama Limitations

**High Recurring Cost**: At $240/year, Sunsama costs significantly more than Things 3's one-time $50 (Mac only) or $80 (full bundle). Over three years, you'd pay $720 for Sunsama versus $80 total for Things 3.

**No GTD Methodology**: Sunsama focuses on daily planning, not long-term task organization. There's no Areas, no Someday list, no GTD-style review workflows. If GTD is your system, Sunsama won't fit.

**Individual Focus Only**: Like Things 3, Sunsama is designed for personal productivity—no team features, shared projects, or delegation.

**Mobile Is Secondary**: While iOS and Android apps exist, Sunsama is clearly optimized for desktop use. Mobile planning feels limited compared to Things 3's excellent iPhone app.

**Complexity for Simple Needs**: Daily planning rituals and extensive integrations can feel like overkill if you just want a simple task list. Sunsama assumes you need sophisticated workflows.

## Things 3 vs Sunsama: Feature-by-Feature Comparison

Let's compare these Mac task managers across the features that matter most.

### Task Management Philosophy

**Things 3**: GTD-based organization. Tasks flow from Inbox to organized Projects within Areas. The system helps you decide what to do *next* based on context and energy, not just schedule.

**Sunsama**: Daily planning focus. Each day is its own canvas. You pull in tasks, schedule them, and work through your time blocks. Long-term organization happens in integrated tools, not Sunsama itself.

**Verdict**: Things 3 for GTD practitioners; Sunsama for daily time blockers.

### Calendar Integration

**Things 3**: Calendar events appear in a sidebar, but there's no two-way sync. Tasks can't become calendar blocks. You can see your schedule but can't integrate tasks with it.

**Sunsama**: Full two-way calendar sync with Google, Outlook, and iCloud. Tasks become time blocks on your calendar. This is Sunsama's core value proposition.

**Verdict**: Sunsama wins decisively for calendar integration—this is the primary reason users choose it over Things 3.

### Time Blocking

**Things 3**: Not supported. You know what's scheduled for today but not when you'll do it.

**Sunsama**: Drag-and-drop time blocking is central to the workflow. Every task can have a specific scheduled time and duration.

**Verdict**: Sunsama—time blocking simply doesn't exist in Things 3.

### Platform Availability

**Things 3**: Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch only. No Windows, Android, Linux, or web.

**Sunsama**: Web, Mac, Windows, iOS, Android. True cross-platform with cloud sync.

**Verdict**: Sunsama for platform flexibility; Things 3 if you're fully Apple.

### Integrations

**Things 3**: No integrations beyond Apple's ecosystem. Tasks must be manually entered.

**Sunsama**: Extensive integrations with Todoist, Trello, Asana, Notion, ClickUp, Jira, Linear, GitHub, Gmail, Slack, and more.

**Verdict**: Sunsama dominates—critical if your tasks originate in project management tools.

### Pricing Model

**Things 3**: One-time purchase ($50 Mac, ~$80 full bundle). Own forever.

**Sunsama**: Subscription ($240/year). Stop paying, lose access.

**Verdict**: Things 3 wins on value—especially over multiple years.

### Focus and Deep Work

**Things 3**: No dedicated focus features.

**Sunsama**: Full focus mode with Pomodoro timer, task expansion, and distraction minimization.

**Verdict**: Sunsama for focus support.

## Price Comparison: One-Time vs Subscription

The pricing models are fundamentally different. Let's see how costs compare over time:

| Timeframe | Things 3 (Full Bundle) | Sunsama | Difference |
|-----------|------------------------|---------|------------|
| **Year 1** | $80 (one-time) | $240 | $160 more for Sunsama |
| **Year 2** | $0 | $240 | $240 more for Sunsama |
| **Year 3** | $0 | $240 | $240 more for Sunsama |
| **3-Year Total** | $80 | $720 | **$640 more for Sunsama** |
| **5-Year Total** | $80 | $1,200 | **$1,120 more for Sunsama** |

If Things 4 releases and requires a new purchase, add ~$80. Still dramatically less than Sunsama's recurring cost.

The question isn't which is cheaper—Things 3 clearly wins. The question is whether Sunsama's calendar integration, time blocking, and integrations are worth $200+/year to your workflow.

## When Things 3 Makes Sense

Things 3 is the right choice if you:

- **Practice GTD**: You want a task manager that supports Getting Things Done methodology natively
- **Prefer one-time purchases**: Subscription fatigue is real, and $50 (Mac) feels better than $240/year
- **Live in Apple's ecosystem**: Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch—you don't need Windows or Android
- **Want beautiful design**: Aesthetics matter to you, and Things 3 is genuinely stunning
- **Don't need calendar integration**: You manage tasks and calendar separately, or you use separate time blocking tools
- **Work independently**: No need for team features or integrations with project management tools
- **Have simple workflows**: GTD structure is enough; you don't need daily planning rituals

**Best for**: GTD practitioners, Apple enthusiasts, solopreneurs, writers, and anyone who values elegant task management without subscription commitments. Also see [Structured vs Sunsama](/blog/structured-vs-sunsama) for another Apple-focused comparison.

## When Sunsama Makes Sense

Sunsama is the right choice if you:

- **Need time blocking**: Scheduling tasks at specific times is central to your productivity

- **Use multiple work tools**: Tasks originate in Asana, Trello, Notion, Linear—you need them unified
- **Need cross-platform access**: You switch between Mac, Windows, or need web access
- **Value daily planning rituals**: Guided morning planning helps you be intentional
- **Want focus support**: Deep work features like Pomodoro timers help you execute
- **Can justify the cost**: $240/year is reasonable for a tool central to your productivity

**Best for**: Knowledge workers, professionals juggling multiple project tools, time blocking enthusiasts, and those who value calendar-first daily planning.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Things 3 better than Sunsama for Mac users?

It depends on your workflow. **Things 3** is better if you practice GTD, prefer one-time purchases, and don't need calendar integration or time blocking. **Sunsama** is better if you want your tasks and calendar unified, need time blocking, and use multiple project management tools. Things 3 is more affordable ($50 vs $240/year); Sunsama is more integrated.

### Does Things 3 have calendar integration?

Things 3 has limited calendar integration—you can *view* calendar events in a sidebar, but there's no two-way sync. Tasks don't become calendar blocks, and you can't drag tasks onto specific times. If calendar integration and time blocking are important, consider Sunsama or Open Sunsama instead.

### What is the best Mac task manager in 2026?

The "best" depends on your needs. **Things 3** excels for GTD practitioners who want beautiful Apple-native design. **Sunsama** excels for calendar-first daily planning with integrations. **Open Sunsama** offers calendar sync and time blocking for free. For pure task management elegance, Things 3. For daily planning with time blocking, Sunsama or Open Sunsama.

### Is Things 3 worth it in 2026?

Yes, if it fits your workflow. Things 3 remains one of the best-designed productivity apps available. At $50 (Mac only) with no subscription, it's excellent value. However, it hasn't changed significantly since 2017, and it lacks features modern users often want: calendar integration, time blocking, and integrations. If you practice GTD and live in Apple's ecosystem, Things 3 is worth it. If you need more, look elsewhere.

### Can I use Things 3 on Windows?

No. Things 3 is exclusively available on Apple devices—Mac, iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. There's no Windows version, no Android app, no web access. If you use any Windows or Android devices, consider cross-platform alternatives like Sunsama or Open Sunsama.

### What are the best Things 3 alternatives?

For GTD practitioners: **OmniFocus** (Apple-only, subscription), **Todoist** (cross-platform, freemium). For daily planning: **Sunsama** (premium, $240/year), **Open Sunsama** (free, open-source). For visual organization: **Notion** (flexible but complex), **TickTick** (cross-platform with calendar). Open Sunsama is the best free alternative with calendar sync and time blocking.

### Does Sunsama work with Things 3?

No direct integration exists between Sunsama and Things 3. Sunsama integrates with Todoist, Asana, Trello, and similar tools—but not Things 3. If you want to use both, you'd need to manually transfer tasks between them.

### Is there a free alternative to Things 3 and Sunsama?

Yes—**Open Sunsama** is a free, open-source daily planner with [calendar sync](/features/calendar-sync), time blocking, and focus mode. It combines Sunsama's calendar-first approach with cross-platform access at no cost. Other options include Todoist (free tier with limitations) and TickTick (free tier with limitations), but Open Sunsama offers the most complete feature set for free. See our full list of [free Sunsama alternatives](/blog/best-free-sunsama-alternatives).

### Which is better for GTD: Things 3 or Sunsama?

**Things 3** is significantly better for GTD. It was designed around GTD principles with Inbox, Today, Upcoming, Anytime, Someday, Projects, and Areas built into the core experience. Sunsama doesn't follow GTD methodology—it focuses on daily planning rather than comprehensive task organization. If GTD is your system, choose Things 3.

### Can I time block with Things 3?

Not directly. Things 3 lacks native time blocking—you can schedule tasks for specific *dates* but not specific *times* with durations. Some users work around this by using Things 3 alongside a separate calendar app, but it's not integrated. If time blocking is essential, Sunsama or Open Sunsama are better choices.

## Conclusion: Things 3 vs Sunsama—Which Should You Choose?

The Things 3 vs Sunsama decision comes down to your productivity philosophy and requirements:

**Choose Things 3** if you're a GTD practitioner who wants elegant, Apple-native task management without subscription fees. Things 3 excels at beautiful design, quick capture, and GTD workflow support. At $50 one-time (Mac), it's remarkably affordable. Best for Apple loyalists who manage tasks separately from their calendar.

**Choose Sunsama** if you want calendar-first daily planning with time blocking and integrations. Sunsama excels at unifying tasks from multiple tools, scheduling work on your calendar, and promoting intentional daily planning. At $240/year, it's a premium investment for knowledge workers who value integrated workflows.

**Choose Open Sunsama** if you want Sunsama's calendar integration and time blocking without the premium price—or if you need cross-platform access that Things 3 can't provide. As the only [free Sunsama alternative](/alternative/sunsama) with full calendar sync, Open Sunsama offers the best value for daily planners who don't want to pay $240/year.

Things 3 and Sunsama solve different problems. One organizes your tasks elegantly; the other integrates them with your calendar. The right choice depends on which problem you need solved.
