Monday.com and Sunsama occupy fundamentally different corners of the productivity software market. Monday.com is an enterprise work operating system designed for team collaboration, project tracking, and workflow automation. Sunsama is a personal daily planner built for individuals who want to manage their time intentionally, one day at a time.

Comparing Monday vs Sunsama is a bit like comparing a cargo ship to a kayak—both get you across water, but they're built for entirely different journeys. Monday.com shines when you need to coordinate complex projects across teams of 10, 50, or 500 people. Sunsama shines when you need to decide what *you* will accomplish today and ensure you have the focused time to do it.

In this comprehensive Monday.com vs Sunsama comparison, we'll explore where each tool excels, who should use which, and introduce a third option—Open Sunsama—for those who want calendar-first daily planning without the enterprise overhead or the $240/year subscription.

Now let's examine each tool in depth to understand which is right for your workflow.

## What is Monday.com?

Monday.com is a work operating system (Work OS) that helps teams plan, track, and manage projects of any size. Launched in 2012 (originally as dapulse), it has grown into one of the largest project management platforms globally, serving over 180,000 organizations including major enterprises like Coca-Cola, Universal, and Canva.

### How Monday.com Works

Monday.com centers on "boards"—customizable spreadsheet-like interfaces where teams organize work items. Each board contains rows (items) and columns (properties like status, dates, people, and custom fields). You can visualize the same data in multiple ways: tables, Kanban boards, Gantt charts, calendars, and timelines.

The platform is designed for team collaboration at every level:

- **Workspaces**: Organize boards by team, department, or project
- **Boards**: Track specific projects or workflows
- **Items**: Individual tasks, deals, tickets, or any work unit
- **Subitems**: Nested tasks for breaking down work
- **Automations**: If-then rules that automate repetitive actions

### Monday.com's Key Features

**Multiple Views**: Monday.com offers exceptional view flexibility. The same board data can be displayed as a table, Kanban board, Gantt chart, calendar, timeline, workload view, or custom dashboard. This makes it adaptable to different team preferences and project types.

**Powerful Automations**: The automation builder lets you create if-then workflows without coding. Examples include: "When status changes to Done, notify the team lead," or "When a date arrives, send a reminder email." These automations save significant time on repetitive tasks.

**Integrations Hub**: Monday.com integrates with 200+ tools including Slack, Microsoft Teams, Gmail, Google Calendar, Salesforce, Jira, and more. The platform can serve as a central hub connecting your entire tool stack.

**Templates Library**: Hundreds of pre-built templates cover use cases from marketing campaigns to software development sprints to CRM pipelines. Teams can start quickly rather than building from scratch.

**Dashboards and Reporting**: Create custom dashboards that pull data from multiple boards. Track KPIs, project health, team workload, and progress across your organization with visual charts and widgets.

### Monday.com Pricing in 2026

Monday.com pricing is per-seat and scales with features:

| Plan | Price/Seat/Month | Key Features |
|------|------------------|--------------|
| **Free** | $0 (up to 2 seats) | Basic boards, limited views |
| **Basic** | $8/seat | Unlimited viewers, 5GB storage |
| **Standard** | $10/seat | Timeline, Gantt, automations (250/month) |
| **Pro** | $16/seat | Time tracking, dependencies, 25k automations |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Advanced security, analytics, support |

For a team of 10 on the Standard plan, that's $100/month or $1,200/year. For enterprise teams of 100+, costs quickly reach five or six figures annually.

### Monday.com's Limitations for Individual Daily Planning

**Designed for Teams, Not Individuals**: Monday.com's entire architecture assumes team collaboration. As a solo user, you're paying for features you'll never use—team permissions, workload views across team members, and collaboration tools.

**No Daily Planning Workflow**: Monday.com excels at project management but offers no guided daily planning ritual. There's no morning review, no intention-setting process, no shutdown routine. You manage projects; you don't plan your personal day.

**Time Blocking is an Afterthought**: While Monday.com has a calendar view, it's designed for project timelines, not personal [time blocking](/blog/what-is-time-blocking). You can't easily drag tasks onto specific hours of your day and see them alongside your calendar events.

**Overwhelming for Simple Needs**: The platform's power comes with complexity. For someone who just wants to plan tomorrow's tasks and protect focused work time, Monday.com is significant overkill.

**Cost Prohibitive for Solo Users**: Paying $8-16/month for project management features when you need daily planning is poor value. The free tier limits you to 2 users and basic features.

## What is Sunsama?

Sunsama is a daily planner built for individual knowledge workers who want to be intentional about how they spend their time. While Monday.com asks "what projects need to get done?", Sunsama asks "what will *you* accomplish today, and when will you do it?"

### How Sunsama Works

Sunsama's core experience is the daily planning ritual. Each morning, the app guides you through a structured process:

1. **Review your calendar**: See existing meetings and commitments
2. **Pull in tasks**: Import tasks from connected tools (Trello, Asana, Linear, etc.)
3. **Set daily intentions**: Consciously decide what you'll work on today
4. **Time block your day**: Drag tasks onto specific calendar slots
5. **Check for overplanning**: Sunsama warns if you've scheduled more than realistic

Throughout the day, you work through your time blocks. Sunsama's focus mode helps you concentrate on one task at a time. At day's end, an optional shutdown ritual helps you reflect on accomplishments and roll incomplete tasks to tomorrow.

### Sunsama's Key Features

**Guided Daily Planning**: The morning ritual transforms planning from an administrative chore into a mindfulness practice. You consciously choose what deserves your time today rather than reactively responding to whatever feels urgent.

**Calendar-First Design**: Everything revolves around the calendar. Tasks without scheduled times are second-class citizens. This forces intentionality—if it doesn't have time on your calendar, does it really deserve your attention today?

**Focus Mode**: When you start working on a task, Sunsama's focus mode expands it to fill your screen, starts a timer, and minimizes distractions. Includes Pomodoro support for structured work sessions.

**Extensive Integrations**: Sunsama shines at pulling tasks from wherever they originate—Todoist, Trello, Asana, Notion, ClickUp, Jira, Linear, GitHub, Gmail, Slack, and more. Two-way sync means changes flow in both directions.

**Sustainable Productivity**: Sunsama tracks estimated task durations and warns when you've scheduled more than can realistically be accomplished. This approach helps prevent burnout by encouraging realistic planning.

### Sunsama Pricing in 2026

Sunsama positions itself as a premium tool:

- **Monthly**: $25/month
- **Annual**: $20/month (billed as $240/year)
- **14-day free trial** (no credit card required)

There is no free tier. Sunsama's pricing reflects its positioning as a professional tool for knowledge workers who value their time highly. At $240/year, it's one of the more expensive personal productivity tools available.

### Sunsama's Limitations

**No Team Project Management**: Sunsama is designed for individuals, not teams. No shared projects, no team dashboards, no workflow automation, no dependencies—features that Monday.com handles well.

**Expensive for What It Offers**: At $240/year, Sunsama costs more than many full project management suites. For budget-conscious users, students, or freelancers, this is significant.

**Limited Customization**: Sunsama's focused design means limited flexibility. You can't build custom views, create complex task hierarchies, or design sophisticated tracking systems.

**No Project-Level Planning**: Sunsama excels at daily planning but offers little for longer-term project planning. For multi-week projects with dependencies, you need additional tools.

## Monday.com vs Sunsama: Feature-by-Feature Comparison

Let's compare these tools across the dimensions that matter most.

### Project Management

**Monday.com**: This is Monday's home turf. Full project management capabilities including Gantt charts, dependencies, milestones, workload management, and timeline views. Complex multi-month projects with dozens of stakeholders are handled elegantly.

**Sunsama**: Minimal project management. You can create tasks with due dates and priorities, but there's no Gantt view, no dependencies, no milestone tracking. Sunsama assumes projects are managed elsewhere and focuses solely on daily execution.

**Verdict**: Monday.com wins decisively for project management. If you need to coordinate complex projects, Sunsama isn't the right tool.

### Daily Planning and Time Blocking

**Monday.com**: Calendar view exists but is designed for project timelines, not personal daily planning. There's no guided morning ritual, no time-blocking optimization, no focus mode. Monday time blocking is possible but awkward.

**Sunsama**: Purpose-built for daily planning and time blocking. Drag tasks onto your calendar to allocate specific hours. See your day as a timeline with meetings and work blocks. Get warnings when you've over-scheduled.

**Verdict**: Sunsama wins decisively. Monday.com daily planning is technically possible but feels like using a bulldozer to plant a garden.

### Calendar Integration

**Monday.com**: Integrates with Google Calendar and Outlook to display events alongside project timelines. However, it's primarily one-way—calendar events inform project planning, but Monday items don't naturally block time on your personal calendar.

**Sunsama**: Full two-way sync with Google Calendar, Outlook, and iCloud. Time-blocked tasks appear on your external calendar so colleagues see your availability. Calendar events are central to daily planning.

**Verdict**: Sunsama's calendar integration is more powerful for personal time blocking.

### Team Collaboration

**Monday.com**: Excellent team features. Shared boards, granular permissions, @mentions, activity feeds, team dashboards, and workload views. Built for teams of any size with sophisticated access controls.

**Sunsama**: Designed for individual use. You can see teammates' daily plans if they also use Sunsama, but there's no shared project workspace, no team permissions, no collaborative features.

**Verdict**: Monday.com wins for teams. Sunsama isn't designed for team collaboration.

### Automation

**Monday.com**: Powerful no-code automation builder. Create triggers and actions across boards, integrate with external tools, and automate repetitive workflows. The Pro plan includes 25,000 automations per month.

**Sunsama**: Limited automation. Some integration automations exist (auto-pull tasks from connected tools), but there's no custom automation builder.

**Verdict**: Monday.com's automation capabilities are far more advanced.

### Focus and Deep Work

**Monday.com**: No focus mode. You're always looking at the full project management interface, potentially with dozens of boards and hundreds of items visible.

**Sunsama**: Dedicated focus mode clears everything except your current task. Timer tracks progress. Pomodoro support for structured work sessions. The interface is designed to reduce visual noise.

**Verdict**: Sunsama prioritizes focused work in a way Monday.com doesn't.

## Pricing Comparison: The True Cost

Let's put the pricing in perspective for different use cases:

| Scenario | Monday.com | Sunsama |
|----------|------------|---------|
| **Solo user** | $96/year (Basic) | $240/year |
| **Team of 5** | $600/year (Standard) | $1,200/year (5 accounts) |
| **Team of 20** | $2,400/year (Standard) | $4,800/year (20 accounts) |
| **Enterprise (100+)** | Custom (5-6 figures) | Not designed for enterprise |

For **solo users** wanting project management, Monday.com is cheaper. For **solo users** wanting daily planning, both are expensive compared to alternatives.

For **teams**, Monday.com provides far more value per dollar. Sunsama's per-user pricing makes it expensive for teams, and it lacks the collaborative features teams need anyway.

And of course, there's a third option: **free**.

## When Monday.com Makes Sense

Choose Monday.com if:

- **You're managing team projects**: Coordinating work across multiple people is Monday.com's strength. Shared boards, permissions, and collaboration features are essential.

- **You need project visualization**: Gantt charts, timelines, and workload views help you understand project status and resource allocation.

- **Workflow automation matters**: If you want to automate repetitive tasks—status updates, notifications, data transfers—Monday.com's automation builder is powerful.

- **You're part of an organization**: Monday.com scales from small teams to enterprises. If your company standardizes on it, having everyone in one system has advantages.

- **Complex dependencies exist**: Multi-week projects with tasks that depend on other tasks need Monday.com's dependency management, not a daily planner.

**Best for**: Project managers, team leads, marketing teams, software development teams, operations teams, and any organization coordinating complex work across multiple people. For similar comparisons, see [Jira vs Sunsama](/blog/jira-vs-sunsama) or [Asana vs Sunsama](/blog/asana-vs-sunsama).

## When Sunsama Makes Sense

Choose Sunsama if:

- **You want intentional daily planning**: The act of consciously deciding what deserves your time today matters to you. You want a guided ritual, not just a task list.

- **Time blocking is central to your work**: You protect focused work time by scheduling it on your calendar. You need tasks and calendar events in one unified view.

- **You work individually**: Your productivity challenge is personal time management, not team coordination.

- **You pull tasks from multiple sources**: You use Trello for one project, Asana for another, Linear for engineering work. Sunsama aggregates tasks from all these tools.

- **You can justify $240/year**: The subscription cost is reasonable for the value you get from intentional daily planning.

**Best for**: Individual knowledge workers, consultants, executives, developers, designers, and anyone who values mindful productivity over feature-rich project management.

## Open Sunsama: Free Daily Planning Without Enterprise Complexity

What if you want Sunsama's calendar-first daily planning philosophy but don't need Monday.com's enterprise features—and don't want to pay $240/year for Sunsama?

Open Sunsama is a free, open-source daily planner that offers time blocking and focused planning without the enterprise overhead or premium subscription.

### Completely Free (Unlike Both)

Open Sunsama has no pricing tiers, no seat-based billing, no premium features locked away. Everything is free for everyone, forever. Unlike Monday.com's limited free tier or Sunsama's complete lack of a free option, Open Sunsama provides full functionality at no cost.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the main difference between Monday.com and Sunsama?

**Monday.com** is a team project management platform (Work OS) designed for coordinating complex projects across organizations. It excels at Gantt charts, workflow automation, and team collaboration. **Sunsama** is a personal daily planner focused on helping individuals plan their day intentionally through time blocking and calendar-first design. They serve fundamentally different purposes.

### Can I use Monday.com for daily planning?

Technically yes, but it's not ideal. Monday.com's calendar view is designed for project timelines, not personal daily planning. There's no guided morning ritual, no time-blocking optimization, and the interface is built for team project management rather than individual focus. You can create a daily planning board, but you're fighting against the tool's design rather than working with it.

### Is Sunsama worth $240/year compared to Monday.com?

It depends on what you need. If you need team project management, Monday.com provides more value. If you need personal daily planning and time blocking, Sunsama's focused approach may be worth the premium—but consider that Open Sunsama offers similar daily planning features for free.

### Can Monday.com and Sunsama work together?

Yes, many users combine them. Monday.com manages team projects and workflows, while Sunsama handles personal daily planning. Sunsama can pull tasks from Monday.com boards, letting you plan your day from work that lives in the team's project management system.

### What's the best free alternative to both Monday.com and Sunsama?

For **daily planning**, Open Sunsama is the best free alternative—it offers [time blocking](/features/time-blocking), [calendar sync](/features/calendar-sync), and focus mode without any cost. See our complete guide to [free Sunsama alternatives](/blog/best-free-sunsama-alternatives). For **project management**, Monday.com's free tier (limited to 2 users) or alternatives like Trello or Asana's free tiers may work for small teams or individuals.

### Is Monday.com overkill for a solo user?

Generally yes. Monday.com's pricing and feature set assume team collaboration. As a solo user, you're paying for team permissions, workload views across members, and collaboration tools you'll never use. For individual task management, simpler tools provide better value.

### Does Sunsama have Gantt charts or project timelines?

No. Sunsama is focused exclusively on daily planning and time blocking. For project-level planning with Gantt charts, timelines, and dependencies, you need a project management tool like Monday.com, Asana, or similar.

### Which is better for remote teams?

**Monday.com** is significantly better for remote teams. It provides the shared visibility, collaboration features, and project tracking that distributed teams need. Sunsama is designed for individual productivity, not team coordination.

### Can I self-host Monday.com or Sunsama?

No. Both are cloud-only services. For self-hosted productivity tools, Open Sunsama is one of the few options that offers time blocking and daily planning with the option to run on your own infrastructure.

### Is there a free way to combine project management with daily planning?

Yes. Use a free project management tool (Trello, Asana free tier, or Monday.com's limited free plan) alongside Open Sunsama for daily planning. Keep your projects and team coordination in the project management tool, then use Open Sunsama each morning to plan what you'll personally accomplish that day.

## Conclusion: Different Tools for Different Problems

The Monday vs Sunsama comparison ultimately reveals that these tools solve different problems:

**Choose Monday.com** if you need to coordinate projects across teams. Its strength is organizational visibility, workflow automation, and collaboration features that help multiple people work together effectively. It's enterprise software priced for enterprise use cases.

**Choose Sunsama** if you need a premium personal daily planner. Its strength is helping individuals be intentional about their time through guided rituals, calendar-first design, and focus-oriented features. The $240/year subscription reflects its positioning as a professional tool.

**Choose Open Sunsama** if you want calendar-first daily planning without enterprise complexity or premium pricing. As a [free Sunsama alternative](/alternative/sunsama), it provides time blocking, calendar sync, and focus mode for free—with the added benefits of open-source transparency and self-hosting options.

The best tool is the one that matches your actual needs. Don't use a team project management platform for personal daily planning, and don't expect a daily planner to manage complex multi-stakeholder projects. Choose the right tool for the job you need to do.
