Sunsama has earned a reputation as one of the most thoughtfully designed daily planners on the market. Its calm interface, daily planning rituals, and seamless calendar integration have won over thousands of productivity enthusiasts. But there's one significant barrier to entry: **Sunsama costs $240 per year** (or $20/month).

For many individuals, freelancers, and small teams, that's a steep price for a task management tool—especially when you're not sure if the daily planning methodology will work for you. The good news? There are excellent free Sunsama alternatives that offer similar (and sometimes superior) functionality without the premium price tag.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll compare the best free alternatives to Sunsama in 2026, including the only open-source option that gives you complete control over your productivity system.

## What Makes Sunsama Special (And Expensive)

Before diving into alternatives, let's understand what Sunsama does well:

- **Daily planning ritual**: Guided morning and evening planning sessions
- **Calendar-first approach**: Time blocking as a core feature, not an afterthought
- **Focus mode**: Distraction-free environment for deep work
- **Integration ecosystem**: Connects with Todoist, Asana, Trello, Linear, and more
- **Calming design**: Intentionally minimal interface to reduce overwhelm

These features justify the price for some users. But if you're budget-conscious or simply prefer not to pay $240/year for task management, you have options.

Now let's dive deep into each alternative.

## 1. Open Sunsama – The Free, Open-Source Alternative

**Price: Free forever | Open source | Self-hostable**

Open Sunsama is a free, open-source daily planner built specifically as an alternative to Sunsama. It captures the essence of what makes Sunsama great—intentional daily planning, time blocking, and a focus on calm productivity—while being completely free and transparent.

### Key Features

Unlike other "free" alternatives that lock essential features behind paywalls, Open Sunsama provides the complete experience at no cost. You get full calendar synchronization with Google Calendar, Outlook, and iCloud—not just read access, but true two-way sync. Time blocking works exactly as you'd expect: drag a task onto your calendar, and it becomes a scheduled block of focused time.

The built-in focus mode is particularly noteworthy. When you're ready to work on a task, entering focus mode expands it to fill your screen, starts an optional timer, and eliminates visual distractions. It's the kind of feature that typically requires a premium subscription elsewhere.

### Why Open Source Matters

Being open source isn't just about price—it's about trust and control. With Open Sunsama, you can:

- **Verify the code**: See exactly how your data is handled
- **Self-host**: Run your own instance on your own servers
- **Contribute**: Suggest features or fix bugs yourself
- **Fork**: Customize the app for your specific needs

For privacy-conscious users and organizations with data sovereignty requirements, open source is the only option that makes sense.

### Who It's Best For

Open Sunsama is ideal for anyone who wants the Sunsama experience without the Sunsama price. It's particularly well-suited for developers (who can contribute to the codebase), privacy advocates (who want to self-host), and anyone frustrated by the proliferation of subscription-based productivity tools.

## 2. TickTick – The Feature-Rich Freemium Option

**Price: Free tier available | Premium: $35.99/year**

TickTick has evolved from a simple task manager into a comprehensive productivity suite. Its free tier is generous enough to serve as a legitimate Sunsama alternative for users with straightforward needs.

### Key Features

The free version of TickTick includes unlimited tasks, lists, and basic reminders. You can create subtasks, set priorities, and organize work across multiple projects. The interface is clean and intuitive, making it easy to capture tasks quickly throughout the day.

TickTick's calendar view shows your tasks alongside time-based events, approximating the time-blocking experience. However, full calendar synchronization (connecting your Google or Outlook calendar) requires the premium subscription. This is a significant limitation for users who want to see their meetings and tasks in one place.

### The Premium Upsell

While TickTick's free tier is functional, it's clearly designed to push you toward premium. Features like calendar integration, custom smart lists, and the Pomodoro timer are locked behind the paywall. At $35.99/year, it's cheaper than Sunsama, but you're still paying for features that are free elsewhere.

### Who It's Best For

TickTick works well for task-focused users who don't need deep calendar integration. If your workflow centers on to-do lists rather than time blocks, and you don't mind some feature limitations, TickTick's free tier is a solid choice. Just be aware that the upgrade prompts can be persistent.

## 3. Morgen – The Calendar Unification Platform

**Price: Free tier available | Premium: $14/month ($168/year)**

Morgen takes a different approach to productivity by focusing on calendar unification. Instead of being a task manager that includes a calendar, it's a calendar app that includes basic task management.

### Key Features

Morgen's strength is bringing all your calendars into one view. If you juggle personal Google Calendar, work Outlook, and family iCloud calendars, Morgen displays them together seamlessly. The free tier allows connection of up to three calendars with full read/write sync.

The scheduling features are particularly impressive. Morgen can find open slots across all your calendars, create booking links for meetings, and even suggest optimal times based on your preferences. For professionals who spend significant time coordinating schedules, these features alone might justify choosing Morgen.

### Limitations

Morgen is calendar-first, which means task management feels like an afterthought. You can create tasks and assign them to time slots, but there's no daily planning ritual, no focus mode, and limited support for recurring tasks. If you're specifically looking for a Sunsama alternative, you might find Morgen's approach too different from what you're seeking.

### Who It's Best For

Morgen excels for users whose primary pain point is calendar fragmentation. If you spend more time scheduling than doing, and your task management needs are simple, Morgen's free tier provides genuine value. For comprehensive daily planning, however, look elsewhere.

## 4. Reclaim.ai – AI-Powered Scheduling

**Price: Free tier available | Premium: $16/month ($192/year)**

Reclaim.ai represents the cutting edge of AI-assisted productivity. Rather than requiring you to manually time block your day, Reclaim automatically finds time for your tasks based on priority, deadlines, and calendar availability.

### Key Features

The core premise is compelling: tell Reclaim what you need to do and how long it will take, and the AI schedules it for you. As your calendar changes—meetings get added, priorities shift—Reclaim automatically reschedules your tasks to accommodate. It's like having a personal assistant managing your time.

The free tier includes up to three calendar connections, basic task scheduling, and habit tracking. The AI scheduling works reasonably well for straightforward tasks, automatically defending time blocks when conflicts arise.

### The Catch

Reclaim's AI-first approach isn't for everyone. Some users find the automatic scheduling disorienting—you might plan to work on a project in the morning, only to find Reclaim moved it to the afternoon because a meeting appeared. There's a loss of intentionality that contradicts Sunsama's philosophy of mindful daily planning.

The free tier also has significant limitations. Advanced features like scheduling links, team coordination, and priority-based scheduling all require premium. And at $192/year for the full experience, you're not saving much compared to Sunsama.

### Who It's Best For

Reclaim.ai suits users who want to automate their scheduling decisions. If you trust AI to manage your time and prefer optimization over intentionality, Reclaim delivers impressive results. For users who value control and mindfulness in their daily planning, the approach may feel too hands-off.

## 5. Structured – Beautiful Daily Planning

**Price: Free tier available | Premium: $34.99/year (one-time on mobile)**

Structured offers a visually stunning approach to daily planning. Originally an iOS app, it's expanded to Mac and now offers a basic web version. The interface is perhaps the most beautiful of any productivity app on the market.

### Key Features

Structured combines a timeline view with a task inbox, creating a clear visual representation of your day. You see exactly how your time is allocated, with tasks and appointments displayed on a vertical timeline. The design emphasizes simplicity—there are no complex features to learn.

The free tier includes basic task management, the timeline view, and Apple Calendar sync. For iOS and Mac users who live within the Apple ecosystem, it provides a genuinely good free experience.

### Limitations

Structured's web version is limited compared to the native apps, and there's no Android support. Calendar sync only works with Apple Calendar in the free tier—Google and Outlook integration requires premium. The feature set is deliberately minimal, which is either refreshing or limiting depending on your needs.

There's also no true focus mode and limited integration options. Structured works best as a standalone planning tool rather than part of a larger productivity system.

### Who It's Best For

Structured is perfect for Apple users who want a beautiful, simple daily planner without the complexity of full-featured tools. If your workflow fits within Apple's ecosystem and you don't need advanced features, Structured's free tier delivers a delightful experience.

## Why Open Sunsama is the Best Free Sunsama Alternative

After examining all the options, Open Sunsama emerges as the clear winner for anyone seeking a true Sunsama alternative that's completely free. Here's why:

### Complete Feature Set at No Cost

While other "free" alternatives lock essential features behind paywalls, Open Sunsama provides everything you need: full calendar sync, time blocking, focus mode, and daily planning workflows. There's no artificial limitation designed to push you toward a premium tier—because there is no premium tier.

### True Open Source Transparency

In an era of data breaches and privacy concerns, knowing exactly how your productivity data is handled matters. Open Sunsama's code is publicly available for inspection. You can verify that your data isn't being sold, mined, or misused. No other alternative offers this level of transparency.

### Self-Hosting Option

For maximum control, you can run Open Sunsama on your own servers. This means your task data never leaves your infrastructure—a requirement for some businesses and a preference for many privacy-conscious individuals. Try finding that option with TickTick or Reclaim.

### Active Development and Community

Open source projects thrive on community involvement. Open Sunsama benefits from contributions by developers worldwide, ensuring continuous improvement and feature additions. If you encounter a bug or want a feature, you can contribute it yourself—or at least see the progress in real time.

### Philosophy Alignment

Open Sunsama was built with the same values as Sunsama: intentional daily planning, respect for your time and attention, and a calm approach to productivity. Other alternatives often prioritize features over philosophy, resulting in cluttered interfaces and overwhelming options.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Sunsama worth $240/year?

Sunsama provides an excellent experience for users who can afford it. The polished interface, reliable integrations, and dedicated support team justify the price for many professionals. However, if budget is a concern, free alternatives like Open Sunsama offer 90% of the value at no cost.

### Can I migrate my data from Sunsama to Open Sunsama?

Yes, Open Sunsama supports data import from various task managers. Since both apps sync with Google Calendar and other calendar providers, your time blocks and scheduled events will appear automatically once you connect your calendars.

### What makes Open Sunsama different from other free alternatives?

Open Sunsama is the only option that's both completely free AND open source. Other free alternatives either limit features to push premium upgrades or keep their code proprietary. Open Sunsama offers full functionality with complete transparency.

### Is self-hosting Open Sunsama difficult?

Self-hosting requires basic server administration knowledge. Open Sunsama provides Docker images and documentation for common hosting platforms. For most users, the hosted version at opensunsama.com is the easiest option—still free, just not self-hosted.

### Does Open Sunsama work offline?

The web app requires an internet connection for full functionality. However, the desktop app (built with Tauri) provides offline access to your tasks and will sync changes when you reconnect.

### How does Open Sunsama make money if it's free?

Open Sunsama is a community-driven project. Operating costs are minimal thanks to efficient architecture, and the project accepts sponsorships from users who want to support continued development. There's no venture capital pressure to monetize aggressively.

### Can teams use Open Sunsama?

Currently, Open Sunsama focuses on individual productivity. Team features are on the roadmap, but the core philosophy emphasizes personal task management and daily planning rather than team coordination.

## Conclusion: Take Control of Your Productivity

Sunsama proved that thoughtful daily planning software can transform how we work. But paying $240/year isn't the only path to intentional productivity. Free alternatives have matured to the point where they genuinely compete with—and sometimes exceed—premium options.

For users who want the Sunsama experience without the cost, **Open Sunsama stands out as the best choice**. It's the only alternative that's completely free, fully open source, and designed with the same philosophy of calm, intentional productivity.

Whether you choose Open Sunsama for its transparency, TickTick for its simplicity, Morgen for calendar unification, Reclaim for AI automation, or Structured for its beautiful design—the important thing is finding a system that works for you.

The best productivity tool is one you'll actually use. And when that tool is free, there's no barrier to getting started.
