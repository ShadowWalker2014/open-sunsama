Choosing between Motion and Sunsama is like choosing between autopilot and manual transmission. Both will get you to your destination, but the journey—and the control you have along the way—is fundamentally different.

Motion promises to end the mental overhead of scheduling by having AI automatically slot your tasks into available time. Sunsama takes the opposite approach, guiding you through intentional daily planning rituals where you consciously decide what deserves your time. Both cost around $20/month. Both have passionate user bases. But they serve very different productivity philosophies.

In this comprehensive Motion vs Sunsama comparison, we'll break down every difference that matters: features, pricing, integrations, and the underlying approach to daily planning. By the end, you'll know exactly which tool fits your workflow—or whether a free alternative like Open Sunsama might be the best choice of all.

Now let's examine each tool in detail.

## What is Motion?

Motion is an AI scheduling app that automatically plans your day based on tasks, meetings, and priorities. Founded in 2019 and popular among busy professionals, Motion's core promise is eliminating the mental work of deciding *when* to do things.

### How Motion Works

When you add a task to Motion, you specify a deadline and estimated duration. Motion's AI then finds the optimal time slot in your calendar, considering your existing meetings, task priorities, and working hours. If a meeting runs over or a new priority emerges, Motion automatically reschedules your tasks.

This automation-first approach appeals to users who:
- Have unpredictable calendars with frequent meeting changes
- Experience decision fatigue when planning their days
- Want to maximize productivity through algorithmic optimization
- Manage multiple projects with competing deadlines

### Motion's Key Features

**AI Auto-Scheduling**: The flagship feature. Motion doesn't just suggest when to work on tasks—it schedules them automatically and adjusts dynamically throughout the day.

**Project Management**: Unlike Sunsama's individual focus, Motion includes robust project management with team features, Gantt charts (on Business tier), and workload balancing.

**Meeting Scheduler**: Built-in scheduling links let others book time with you, similar to Calendly but integrated with your task calendar.

**Productivity Analytics**: Business tier includes dashboards showing how you spend your time, team capacity, and productivity trends.

### Motion Pricing in 2026

Motion offers two main tiers:

- **Pro AI**: $19/seat/month (annual) or $34/month (monthly)
- **Business AI**: $29/seat/month (annual)

Both include a 7-day free trial. There's no free tier—Motion is a premium-only product.

### Motion's Limitations

For all its automation power, Motion has notable drawbacks:

**Less Control**: When AI schedules your day, you lose the intentionality of choosing what deserves your time. Some users find rescheduled tasks disorienting.

**Busier Interface**: With project management, team features, and AI suggestions, Motion's UI is more complex than minimalist planners.

**Limited Integrations**: Motion integrates with calendars and basic tools, but lacks the deep integrations with task managers (Todoist, Asana) that Sunsama offers.

**No Focus Mode**: Despite being a productivity app, Motion doesn't include a dedicated focus or deep work mode.

## What is Sunsama?

Sunsama is a daily planner built around mindful, intentional planning. Rather than automating your schedule, Sunsama guides you through conscious decisions about what to work on each day. The app emphasizes calm productivity over relentless optimization.

### How Sunsama Works

Each morning, Sunsama walks you through a planning ritual. You review your calendar, pull in tasks from various sources (Trello, Asana, Gmail, etc.), and deliberately schedule what you'll accomplish today. The app warns you if you're overplanning—a feature that acknowledges human limitations rather than optimizing around them.

Throughout the day, you manually drag tasks onto your calendar as time blocks. At day's end, an optional shutdown ritual helps you reflect on what you accomplished and roll incomplete tasks to tomorrow.

This intentional approach appeals to users who:
- Value mindfulness and conscious decision-making
- Want to prevent overwork and burnout
- Prefer pulling tasks from various tools into a unified daily view
- Find automated scheduling too impersonal

### Sunsama's Key Features

**Daily Planning Ritual**: Guided morning sessions help you set realistic daily goals. This ritual is central to Sunsama's philosophy—planning is not overhead, it's the practice.

**Focus Mode**: When working on a task, focus mode expands it to fill the screen, starts a timer, and minimizes distractions. Includes Pomodoro timer support.

**Extensive Integrations**: Two-way sync with Todoist, Trello, Asana, Notion, ClickUp, Jira, Linear, Gmail, Slack, and more. Pull tasks from wherever they originate.

**Overplanning Warnings**: Sunsama tracks estimated time and alerts you when you've scheduled more than is realistic—promoting sustainable productivity.

**Calm Interface**: Deliberately minimal design reduces cognitive load. The UI is sparse, focused, and surprisingly soothing.

### Sunsama Pricing in 2026

Sunsama recently increased pricing after keeping it steady for five years:

- **Monthly**: $25/month
- **Annual**: $20/month (billed as $240/year)

A 14-day free trial is available, no credit card required.

### Sunsama's Limitations

**No AI Automation**: If you want software to schedule your day, Sunsama won't help. Everything is manual and intentional.

**Individual Focus Only**: Sunsama is designed for personal productivity, not team collaboration. No shared projects or team dashboards.

**No Meeting Scheduler**: You'll need a separate tool like Calendly for booking links.

**Mobile Experience**: While apps exist for iOS and Android, Sunsama is primarily designed for desktop use.

## Motion vs Sunsama: Feature-by-Feature Comparison

Let's compare these AI scheduling apps across the features that matter most.

### Time Blocking

**Motion**: Time blocking happens automatically. Add a task with a deadline, and Motion finds the optimal slot. Blocks adjust dynamically as your calendar changes.

**Sunsama**: Time blocking is manual. You drag tasks from your list onto specific calendar times. This requires more effort but gives complete control.

**Verdict**: Motion for efficiency, Sunsama for intentionality.

### Calendar Synchronization

**Motion**: Full two-way sync with Google Calendar and Outlook. Your task blocks appear on your calendar, and external events inform AI scheduling.

**Sunsama**: Excellent calendar sync with Google, Outlook, and iCloud. Two-way sync means changes flow both directions.

**Verdict**: Tie—both handle calendar sync well.

### AI Features

**Motion**: AI is the core product. Automatic scheduling, dynamic rescheduling, priority optimization, and meeting time suggestions.

**Sunsama**: No AI features. Sunsama is deliberately manual, though they've added basic automation like auto-rollover for incomplete tasks.

**Verdict**: Motion dominates if you want AI; Sunsama if you prefer human control.

### Integrations

**Motion**: Integrates with Google Calendar, Outlook, Zoom, and Zapier. Project integrations are limited compared to dedicated task managers.

**Sunsama**: Extensive native integrations with Todoist, Trello, Asana, Notion, ClickUp, Jira, Linear, GitHub, Gmail, Slack, and more. Best-in-class for pulling tasks from multiple sources.

**Verdict**: Sunsama wins decisively on integrations.

### Focus and Deep Work

**Motion**: No dedicated focus mode. The app optimizes scheduling but doesn't help with execution.

**Sunsama**: Excellent focus mode with Pomodoro timer, task expansion, and distraction hiding. Designed to help you actually do the work, not just plan it.

**Verdict**: Sunsama wins—focus mode is a significant advantage.

### Project Management

**Motion**: Includes project management features, team workspaces, Gantt charts (Business tier), and resource planning. Suitable for teams managing multiple projects.

**Sunsama**: Individual-focused only. No team features, no project hierarchies, no resource planning.

**Verdict**: Motion for teams and complex projects; Sunsama for individual contributors.

### User Interface

**Motion**: Feature-rich interface with multiple views, project panels, and AI suggestions. More complex but more powerful.

**Sunsama**: Deliberately minimal, calm interface. Prioritizes focus over features. Some find it limiting; others find it liberating.

**Verdict**: Subjective—depends on your preference for simplicity vs. power.

## Pricing Comparison: Motion vs Sunsama vs Open Sunsama

Cost matters, especially for tools you'll use daily. Here's how the three options compare:

| **Team Pricing** | Per-seat | Per-seat | Free |
| **Trial** | 7 days | 14 days | Unlimited |

**Annual Costs**:
- Motion Pro AI: $228/year

Neither Motion nor Sunsama offers a free tier. If budget is a concern, Open Sunsama provides similar functionality—time blocking, calendar sync, focus mode—at no cost.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Motion or Sunsama better for ADHD?

Both tools can help with ADHD, but in different ways. **Motion** reduces decision fatigue by automating scheduling—you don't have to decide when to work on things. **Sunsama** provides structure through daily rituals and visual time blocking. Many ADHD users prefer Motion's automation, but others find Sunsama's intentional approach helps them stay mindful. The free trial for each lets you test which works better for your brain.

### Can I use Motion and Sunsama together?

Technically yes, but it's not recommended. Both tools want to be your central planning hub, and using both creates duplicate work and potential conflicts. If you like Motion's AI scheduling but want Sunsama's integrations, consider whether Open Sunsama might bridge that gap at no cost.

### Which has better mobile apps?

**Motion** has more robust mobile apps with full functionality on iOS and Android. **Sunsama's** mobile experience is functional but clearly secondary to desktop. If mobile planning is important to your workflow, Motion currently has the edge.

### Does Motion or Sunsama integrate with Notion?

**Sunsama** has native two-way Notion integration, allowing you to pull tasks from Notion databases. **Motion** does not have direct Notion integration—you'd need to use Zapier as a workaround. For Notion users, Sunsama is the clear choice.

### What happens to my data if I cancel?

Both Motion and Sunsama let you export your data before canceling. However, since your tasks and time blocks are typically synced to your calendar anyway, the calendar events remain even after cancellation. With **Open Sunsama**, you can self-host and maintain complete control of your data indefinitely.

### Is there a free alternative to Motion and Sunsama?

Yes—**Open Sunsama** is a free, open-source daily planner with time blocking, calendar sync, and focus mode. It combines Sunsama's intentional planning philosophy with modern features at no cost. Other free options like TickTick and Morgen exist but have significant feature limitations in their free tiers.

### Which is better for freelancers?

**Sunsama** typically works better for freelancers who need to integrate tasks from multiple clients and tools (Trello, Asana, email). Its intentional planning helps prevent overcommitment. **Motion** can work but its project management features are overkill for most freelancers, and the AI scheduling may feel impersonal. **Open Sunsama** offers a balanced approach with no subscription cost—ideal for freelancers watching their expenses.

### How do Motion and Sunsama handle recurring tasks?

Both handle recurring tasks well. **Motion** automatically schedules recurring tasks based on your preferences and available time. **Sunsama** shows recurring tasks in your daily planning view, letting you decide when to schedule them. The key difference is automation vs. intention—Motion schedules for you, Sunsama lets you decide.

## Conclusion: Motion vs Sunsama—Which Should You Choose?

The Motion vs Sunsama debate ultimately comes down to philosophy:

**Choose Motion** if you want AI to optimize your schedule and you trust algorithms to make good decisions about your time. Motion excels at reducing cognitive load, adapting to calendar chaos, and managing team projects.

**Choose Sunsama** if you value intentional planning and want full control over your daily decisions. Sunsama excels at integrations, focus mode, and promoting sustainable productivity through mindful rituals.

**Choose Open Sunsama** if you want the benefits of intentional daily planning without the $240/year price tag. As the only free, open-source option in this category, Open Sunsama offers time blocking, focus mode, and calendar sync at no cost—with the added benefits of self-hosting and code transparency.

The best productivity tool is one you'll actually use. Both Motion and Sunsama offer free trials—use them. And if neither feels quite right, or if the price gives you pause, Open Sunsama is always free to try.
