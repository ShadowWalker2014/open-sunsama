Structured and Sunsama both promise the same thing: a beautifully designed day planner that helps you take control of your time. But beneath their polished interfaces, these tools represent fundamentally different philosophies—and serve different types of users.

Structured is a visual timeline planner built exclusively for the Apple ecosystem. It transforms your day into a gorgeous vertical timeline where tasks flow naturally from morning to night. At $35/year, it's remarkably affordable and beloved by visual thinkers who live within Apple's walled garden.

Sunsama takes a calendar-first approach with extensive integrations and cross-platform support. It guides you through daily planning rituals, pulls tasks from dozens of tools, and syncs bidirectionally with your calendar. At $240/year, it's a premium product aimed at knowledge workers juggling multiple project management systems.

In this comprehensive Structured app vs Sunsama comparison, we'll examine both tools in detail—features, pricing, platform support, and ideal use cases. We'll also introduce Open Sunsama, a free cross-platform alternative that offers the best of both worlds.

Now let's examine each daily planner app in detail.

## What is Structured?

Structured is a visual day planning app designed exclusively for iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch. Launched by a small indie team, it's become one of the most popular productivity apps in the Apple App Store, praised for its beautiful timeline interface and intuitive design.

### How Structured Works

Structured displays your day as a vertical timeline—think of it as a waterfall of tasks flowing from morning to evening. Each task appears as a colored block positioned at its scheduled time, giving you an immediate visual sense of how your day is structured.

The experience is refreshingly simple:

1. **Add tasks**: Tap a time slot to add a task with duration and optional notes
2. **Drag to reschedule**: Move tasks up or down the timeline to adjust timing
3. **Check off completions**: Tasks fade as you complete them, showing progress through your day
4. **Review at a glance**: The timeline instantly communicates what's coming next

Calendar events from Apple Calendar appear automatically on your timeline, creating a unified view of commitments and planned work.

### Structured's Key Features

**Visual Timeline Interface**: This is Structured's signature feature. Instead of a list or calendar grid, you see your day as a continuous visual flow. Many users find this representation more intuitive than traditional calendar views—especially visual thinkers and those with ADHD who benefit from spatial representation. Learn more about [time blocking](/blog/what-is-time-blocking) as a productivity method.

**Apple Ecosystem Integration**: Structured integrates deeply with Apple technologies. Siri Shortcuts let you add tasks by voice. Apple Watch complications show your current and next tasks. iOS and macOS widgets display your timeline on home screens. Reminders can import into Structured.

**Recurring Tasks**: Set up daily, weekly, or custom recurring tasks. Your morning routine, weekly reviews, and daily exercise automatically populate your timeline.

**Timeline Templates**: Create template days (like "Work Day" or "Weekend") with pre-built task structures. Apply templates to quickly populate your schedule.

**Focus Indicators**: Mark certain tasks as focus-intensive. Structured can integrate with Apple's Focus modes to reduce distractions during these blocks.

**Beautiful Design**: Structured is genuinely one of the best-designed productivity apps on iOS. The interface is clean, animations are smooth, and the overall experience feels premium. This isn't just aesthetics—good design reduces cognitive load.

### Structured Pricing in 2026

Structured offers a generous free tier and affordable premium:

**Free Plan** includes:
- Unlimited tasks
- Basic timeline view
- Apple Calendar sync
- Apple Watch app

**Structured Pro**: $2.99/month or $34.99/year
- Recurring tasks
- Multiple calendars
- Templates
- Advanced widgets
- Priority support

At roughly $35/year, Structured Pro is remarkably affordable compared to most productivity subscriptions. There's also a lifetime purchase option for $49.99.

### Structured's Limitations

**Apple-Only Ecosystem**: This is the biggest limitation. Structured exists only on iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch. No Android, no Windows, no Linux, no web app. If you use any non-Apple device—even occasionally—Structured can't be your primary planner.

**Limited Integrations**: Beyond Apple Calendar and Reminders, Structured doesn't integrate with third-party tools. You can't pull tasks from Todoist, Asana, Trello, Notion, or project management tools. If your work lives in these systems, you'll manually duplicate tasks.

**No Team Features**: Structured is purely individual. No shared calendars, no task delegation, no team visibility. This is by design—it's a personal planner—but limits use in collaborative environments.

**Basic Task Management**: Structured focuses on when you'll do tasks, not on organizing them in project hierarchies. No subtasks, no complex tagging, no smart filters. It assumes you track tasks elsewhere and use Structured purely for daily scheduling.

**No Cross-Platform Sync**: Because Structured only exists on Apple devices, there's no way to access your schedule from a Windows work computer or Android tablet. Your planning is locked to your Apple devices.

## What is Sunsama?

Sunsama is a cross-platform daily planner built around mindful, intentional productivity. Unlike Structured's visual timeline, Sunsama centers on the calendar grid and guides users through structured planning rituals. It's designed for knowledge workers who juggle tasks across multiple systems.

### How Sunsama Works

Sunsama's core experience is the daily planning ritual. Each morning, the app walks you through a structured process:

1. **Review your calendar**: See meetings and existing commitments
2. **Pull in tasks**: Import tasks from connected tools (Trello, Asana, Notion, Linear, etc.)
3. **Set daily intentions**: Consciously decide what you'll accomplish today
4. **Time block your schedule**: Drag tasks onto specific calendar times
5. **Check capacity**: Sunsama warns if you've scheduled more than is realistic

Throughout the day, you work through your time blocks, using focus mode to concentrate on individual tasks. At day's end, an optional shutdown ritual helps you reflect and roll incomplete tasks forward.

### Sunsama's Key Features

**Guided Daily Planning**: The morning ritual isn't just a feature—it's Sunsama's philosophy made tangible. You consciously choose what deserves your time today rather than reactively working through an endless task list.

**Extensive Integrations**: This is where Sunsama shines. Native two-way sync with Todoist, Trello, Asana, Notion, ClickUp, Jira, Linear, GitHub, Gmail, Slack, and more. Pull tasks from wherever they originate; changes sync back to the source system.

**Cross-Platform Access**: Sunsama works on web, Mac, and Windows. While the mobile experience is secondary, you can access your schedule from any computer—not just Apple devices.

**Focus Mode**: When working on a task, [focus mode](/features/focus-mode) expands it to fill your screen, starts a timer, and minimizes distractions. Pomodoro timer support helps structure deep work sessions.

**Two-Way Calendar Sync**: Full bidirectional sync with Google Calendar, Outlook, and iCloud. Time blocks you create in Sunsama appear on your calendar; events from your calendar appear in Sunsama.

**Overplanning Prevention**: Sunsama tracks estimated task durations and warns when you've scheduled more than can realistically be accomplished—promoting sustainable productivity.

### Sunsama Pricing in 2026

Sunsama is a premium product with premium pricing:

- **Monthly**: $25/month
- **Annual**: $20/month (billed as $240/year)
- **14-day free trial** (no credit card required)

There is no free tier. Sunsama's pricing reflects its positioning as a professional tool for knowledge workers.

### Sunsama's Limitations

**High Price Point**: At $240/year, Sunsama costs nearly 7x more than Structured. For budget-conscious users, students, or freelancers, this premium pricing is significant.

**Less Visual Timeline**: While Sunsama shows tasks on a calendar, it lacks Structured's distinctive visual timeline aesthetic. If you're specifically drawn to timeline visualization, Sunsama's calendar grid may feel conventional.

**Mobile Apps Are Secondary**: Sunsama has iOS and Android apps, but the experience is clearly optimized for desktop. Mobile planning feels limited compared to Structured's polished mobile experience.

**No Apple Watch Support**: Unlike Structured, Sunsama has no watch app. If quick glances at your wrist help you stay on track, this matters.

**Complexity for Simple Needs**: Sunsama's planning rituals, integrations, and features can feel like overkill if you just want a simple visual schedule. The app assumes you need sophisticated daily planning.

## Structured vs Sunsama: Feature-by-Feature Comparison

Let's compare these visual day planners across the features that matter most.

### Visual Design and Timeline

**Structured**: The timeline interface is Structured's defining feature. Your day flows vertically from morning to night, with tasks as colored blocks at their scheduled times. This spatial representation helps visual thinkers grasp their day instantly.

**Sunsama**: Uses a traditional calendar grid view—time slots in columns, days in rows. While functional, it's visually conventional compared to Structured's distinctive timeline.

**Verdict**: Structured wins for visual impact and intuitive timeline representation.

### Platform Availability

**Structured**: Apple ecosystem only—iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch. No Android, Windows, Linux, or web access.

**Sunsama**: Web, Mac, Windows, iOS, and Android. True cross-platform support with cloud sync across all devices.

**Verdict**: Sunsama wins decisively for platform flexibility.

### Calendar Integration

**Structured**: One-way sync with Apple Calendar. Events appear on your timeline, but Structured tasks don't write back to your calendar. Limited to Apple's calendar ecosystem.

**Sunsama**: Full two-way sync with Google Calendar, Outlook, and iCloud. Time blocks appear on your external calendar; changes sync bidirectionally.

**Verdict**: Sunsama's calendar integration is significantly more powerful and flexible.

### Integrations with Work Tools

**Structured**: No integrations beyond Apple's built-in apps. You can't pull tasks from Todoist, Asana, Notion, or project management tools.

**Sunsama**: Extensive native integrations with Todoist, Trello, Asana, Notion, ClickUp, Jira, Linear, GitHub, Gmail, Slack, and more. Tasks flow from your work tools into your daily plan.

**Verdict**: Sunsama dominates—particularly valuable if you use multiple productivity tools.

### Focus and Deep Work

**Structured**: Basic focus support through Apple Focus mode integration. No built-in timer or distraction-blocking features.

**Sunsama**: Full focus mode with task expansion, Pomodoro timer, and distraction minimization. Designed to help you execute, not just plan.

**Verdict**: Sunsama wins for dedicated focus features.

### Mobile Experience

**Structured**: Excellent native iOS experience. The timeline interface translates beautifully to mobile. Apple Watch complications provide quick glances at your schedule.

**Sunsama**: Functional mobile apps that feel secondary to desktop. No Apple Watch support.

**Verdict**: Structured wins for mobile planning—especially for Apple users.

### Daily Planning Process

**Structured**: Freeform—add tasks when you want, arrange them as you see fit. No guided process, no planning rituals.

**Sunsama**: Structured (ironically) morning rituals guide you through intentional daily planning. The app actively shapes how you think about your day.

**Verdict**: Depends on preference—Sunsama for guided planning, Structured for flexibility.

## Pricing Comparison: The $200/Year Difference

Let's put the pricing in perspective:

| Timeframe | Structured Pro | Sunsama | Difference |
|-----------|----------------|---------|------------|
| **Monthly** | $2.99/month | $25/month | $22.01/month |
| **Annual** | $34.99/year | $240/year | $205/year |
| **3 Years** | ~$105 | $720 | $615 |
| **Lifetime** | $49.99 (one-time) | N/A | N/A |

Over three years, you'd pay $615 more for Sunsama than Structured. Structured's lifetime purchase ($49.99) is less than three months of Sunsama.

Is Sunsama worth 7x the price? That depends entirely on whether you need:
- Cross-platform access
- Deep integrations with work tools
- Guided daily planning rituals
- Two-way calendar sync with non-Apple calendars

If you're fully invested in Apple's ecosystem and don't need integrations, Structured delivers excellent value. If you need cross-platform support or work tool integrations, Sunsama—or a free alternative—may justify its premium.

## When Structured Makes Sense

Structured is the right choice if you:

- **Live in Apple's ecosystem**: Your phone, tablet, computer, and watch are all Apple. You don't need Windows or Android access.
- **Love visual timelines**: The vertical timeline representation resonates with how you think about time.
- **Want simplicity**: You don't need complex integrations or planning rituals—just a beautiful way to schedule your day.
- **Are budget-conscious**: $35/year (or $50 lifetime) fits your budget better than $240/year.
- **Use Apple Calendar**: Your calendar ecosystem is Apple-native, not Google or Outlook.
- **Value mobile planning**: Your iPhone or iPad is your primary planning device.
- **Have ADHD or are a visual learner**: The spatial timeline representation helps you internalize your schedule.

**Best for**: Apple enthusiasts, visual thinkers, students, freelancers on a budget, and anyone who wants a beautiful timeline planner without complexity. Also compare [Things 3 vs Sunsama](/blog/things-3-vs-sunsama) for another Apple-focused option.

## When Sunsama Makes Sense

Sunsama is the right choice if you:

- **Need cross-platform access**: You switch between Mac, Windows, or need web access from any computer.
- **Use multiple work tools**: Tasks live in Asana, Trello, Notion, Jira, or similar—you need them pulled into one view.
- **Value intentional planning**: Guided morning rituals help you be more deliberate about daily choices.
- **Use Google or Outlook Calendar**: Your calendar ecosystem isn't Apple-centric.
- **Need focus mode**: Deep work requires more than scheduling—you need execution support.
- **Can justify premium pricing**: $240/year is reasonable for a tool central to your productivity.

**Best for**: Knowledge workers, professionals using multiple project management systems, cross-platform users, and those who value mindfulness in productivity.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the main difference between Structured and Sunsama?

**Structured** is a visual timeline planner built exclusively for Apple devices, featuring a distinctive vertical day view and beautiful design at $35/year. **Sunsama** is a cross-platform daily planner with extensive integrations, guided planning rituals, and a calendar-first approach at $240/year. Structured excels at visual simplicity within Apple's ecosystem; Sunsama excels at pulling tasks from multiple tools across any platform.

### Can I use Structured on Windows or Android?

No. Structured is exclusively available on Apple devices—iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch. There are no Windows, Android, Linux, or web versions. If you use any non-Apple devices, consider Sunsama or Open Sunsama as cross-platform alternatives.

### Is Structured app good for ADHD?

Many ADHD users find Structured helpful because of its visual timeline representation. Seeing your day as spatial blocks—rather than a list—helps internalize when tasks happen. The visual design reduces cognitive load, and the Apple Watch app provides gentle reminders. However, Structured lacks the structured planning rituals that some ADHD users find beneficial in Sunsama.

### Does Structured integrate with Todoist or Asana?

No. Structured only integrates with Apple's built-in apps (Calendar, Reminders). You cannot pull tasks from third-party tools like Todoist, Asana, Notion, or project management software. If your tasks live in these systems, you'd need to manually add them to Structured or use Sunsama's native integrations instead.

### Which is better for students: Structured or Sunsama?

**Structured** is generally better for students due to its affordable pricing ($35/year or $50 lifetime) and intuitive visual interface. Most students use Apple devices, making platform limitations less relevant. Sunsama's $240/year pricing is harder to justify on a student budget. However, if you need to pull assignments from tools like Notion or Asana, Sunsama's integrations may be worth the premium.

### Can I try both Structured and Sunsama for free?

Yes. **Structured** offers a generous free tier with unlimited tasks and basic timeline features—you can use it indefinitely without paying. **Sunsama** offers a 14-day free trial (no credit card required), after which you must subscribe. **Open Sunsama** is completely free forever with no trial limitations.

### Is there a free alternative to both Structured and Sunsama?

Yes—**Open Sunsama** is a free, open-source daily planner with time blocking, [calendar sync](/features/calendar-sync), focus mode, and cross-platform support. It combines Sunsama's flexibility with Structured's visual appeal at no cost. See our complete guide to [free Sunsama alternatives](/blog/best-free-sunsama-alternatives) for more options.

### Which has better calendar sync?

**Sunsama** has significantly better calendar sync with full two-way integration across Google Calendar, Outlook, and iCloud. Time blocks you create appear on your calendar; changes flow both directions. **Structured** only syncs one-way with Apple Calendar—events appear on your timeline, but Structured tasks don't write back to your calendar. For non-Apple calendar users, Sunsama is the clear choice.

### Can I migrate from Structured to Sunsama?

There's no direct migration path. You'd recreate your task structure manually in Sunsama. However, Sunsama is designed to pull tasks from other tools (Todoist, Asana, etc.) rather than serve as your primary task repository. Many users switch by connecting Sunsama to existing project management tools rather than recreating Structured's tasks.

### Which is better for daily planning rituals?

**Sunsama** wins this comparison. Its guided morning ritual walks you through reviewing your calendar, pulling in tasks, setting intentions, and time blocking your day. **Structured** has no planning rituals—it's a flexible canvas where you add and arrange tasks as you see fit. If structured planning processes help you be more intentional, Sunsama's approach may resonate more.

## Conclusion: Structured vs Sunsama—Which Should You Choose?

The Structured app vs Sunsama decision ultimately comes down to your ecosystem and needs:

**Choose Structured** if you're fully invested in Apple's ecosystem and want a beautiful, affordable visual timeline planner. Structured excels at spatial day visualization, mobile planning, and simple elegance. At $35/year (or $50 lifetime), it's remarkably cost-effective. Best for visual thinkers, Apple enthusiasts, and budget-conscious users who don't need cross-platform access or third-party integrations.

**Choose Sunsama** if you need cross-platform access, extensive integrations with work tools, or guided daily planning rituals. Sunsama excels at pulling tasks from multiple sources into one intentional daily view. At $240/year, it's a premium tool for professionals who value mindful productivity and can justify the investment.

**Choose Open Sunsama** if you want the best of both worlds—cross-platform flexibility, visual planning, and calendar sync—without paying $240/year or being locked into Apple's ecosystem. As the only [free Sunsama alternative](/alternative/sunsama) in this category, Open Sunsama offers time blocking, focus mode, and full calendar integration at no cost.

The best daily planner is one you'll actually use. Structured's free tier and Sunsama's 14-day trial let you experience both approaches before committing. And if neither feels quite right, or if the pricing gives you pause, Open Sunsama is always free to try.
