You've probably been here before: you download a "free" daily planner app, spend an hour setting it up, import your tasks, and then—right when you try to use a core feature—a popup appears asking you to upgrade to premium. **The free planner app you thought you found wasn't free at all.**

This is the freemium trap, and it's become the dominant business model in productivity software. Companies advertise "free" daily planners knowing full well that the free tier is deliberately crippled. The goal isn't to help you plan your day—it's to get you invested enough that you'll pay to unlock what you need.

In 2026, finding a **best free daily planner app** that's actually free—without artificial limits, premium upsells, or hidden costs—requires cutting through marketing noise. We've tested eight popular options and evaluated them on one simple criterion: can you actually plan your days effectively without paying?

The short answer? Most "free" daily planners fail this test. But there's one option that delivers the complete experience at no cost: **Open Sunsama**, the only open-source daily planner that's free forever with no feature restrictions.

Let's break down what "free" really means, compare your options, and help you find a daily planner that respects both your time and your budget.

## What "Free" Actually Means: Free Tier vs. Completely Free

Before comparing apps, let's establish what we're looking for. There's a significant difference between these two types of "free":

### Free Tier (Freemium)

Most productivity apps offer a **free tier**—a limited version designed to give you a taste of the product. Common restrictions include:

- Limited number of tasks or projects
- No calendar integration (or read-only access)
- Basic features only (no time blocking, no focus mode)
- Watermarks or branding on shared content
- Single device usage
- No team collaboration
- Limited storage for attachments
- Ads or constant upgrade prompts

The free tier exists to convert you into a paying customer. If the free version actually met your needs, why would you ever upgrade?

### Completely Free (No Premium Tier)

A truly free app has no paid tier at all. The product you get is the product—no artificial limitations designed to frustrate you into paying. This model is rare because it requires alternative funding (open source community support, donations, or complementary paid services).

**Open Sunsama** falls into this category. There's no "Pro" version waiting behind a paywall. Every feature is available to every user, forever.

### The Free Task Planner Reality Check

When evaluating any **free task planner**, ask these questions:

1. Can I sync my calendar without paying?
2. Can I time block tasks onto my schedule?
3. Is there a limit on tasks, projects, or features?
4. Will I see upgrade prompts constantly?
5. Can I use it long-term without hitting a wall?

Most apps fail at least two of these tests. Keep this framework in mind as we compare options.

## Quick Comparison: Best Free Daily Planner Apps

Here's an honest comparison of the eight most popular **daily planner app free** options in 2026:

| App | Truly Free? | Calendar Sync | Time Blocking | Task Limits | Focus Mode | Upgrade Pressure |
|-----|-------------|---------------|---------------|-------------|------------|------------------|
| **Open Sunsama** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Full 2-way | ✅ Full | Unlimited | ✅ Built-in | None |
| Google Calendar | ✅ Yes | ✅ Native | ⚠️ Manual | N/A | ❌ No | Low |
| Todoist | ❌ Freemium | ⚠️ 1-way only | ❌ No | 5 projects | ❌ No | High |
| TickTick | ❌ Freemium | ❌ Premium only | ⚠️ Limited | 9 lists | ⚠️ Premium | Medium |
| Notion | ⚠️ Mostly | ❌ No native | ⚠️ Manual | Unlimited | ❌ No | Low |
| Microsoft To Do | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Outlook only | ❌ No | Unlimited | ❌ No | None |
| Any.do | ❌ Freemium | ❌ Premium only | ❌ Premium | Limited | ❌ Premium | Very High |
| Google Tasks | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Basic | ❌ No | Unlimited | ❌ No | None |

**Legend**: ✅ Full support | ⚠️ Limited | ❌ Not available or premium-only

The pattern is clear: most "free" daily planners restrict the features that matter most—calendar integration and time blocking—to their paid tiers. Only a few options deliver genuine value without payment.

Now let's examine each app in detail.

## 1. Open Sunsama – The Best Free Daily Planner (No Limits)

**Price: Completely free | Open source | Self-hostable**

Open Sunsama is a **free daily planner app** built on a radical premise: productivity software should be free, transparent, and respect your data. It offers the complete daily planning experience—calendar sync, time blocking, focus mode, and kanban organization—without any premium tier or artificial restrictions.

### Why It's the Best Free Option

Unlike freemium alternatives that lock essential features behind paywalls, Open Sunsama provides everything from day one:

- **Full calendar synchronization**: Connect Google Calendar, Outlook, or iCloud with true two-way sync. When you create a time block in Open Sunsama, it appears on your calendar. When you add an event to your calendar, it shows up in Open Sunsama. No "read-only" limitations.

- **Complete time blocking**: Drag any task onto your timeline to schedule it. Resize blocks to adjust duration. Your day becomes a visual representation of how you'll spend your time—not a wishful to-do list.

- **Built-in focus mode**: When it's time to work, click into focus mode. Your task expands to fill the screen, an optional timer tracks your progress, and distractions disappear. This feature typically costs $5-20/month elsewhere.

- **Unlimited everything**: No caps on tasks, projects, subtasks, or attachments. Use it as heavily as you need.

### Open Source Advantage

Open Sunsama's code is publicly available on GitHub. This matters for several reasons:

**Transparency**: You can see exactly how your data is handled. There's no black box—every function, every API call, every data transformation is visible. In an era of data breaches and privacy concerns, this transparency is invaluable.

**Self-hosting**: Run Open Sunsama on your own servers if you prefer. Your productivity data stays on infrastructure you control. This is a requirement for some businesses and a preference for privacy-conscious individuals.

**Community development**: Bugs get fixed faster when anyone can contribute. Features get added based on user needs, not upsell potential. The roadmap is driven by usefulness, not revenue.

**No vendor lock-in**: If Open Sunsama ever stopped development, the code would still exist. Your data remains yours. Compare this to proprietary apps that could shut down, get acquired, or pivot—taking your productivity system with them.

### Daily Planning Workflow

Open Sunsama supports the intentional daily planning methodology that made apps like Sunsama popular:

1. **Morning planning**: Review your tasks and calendar. Decide what you'll realistically accomplish today.
2. **Time blocking**: Assign specific times to your chosen tasks. Commit to when each task happens.
3. **Focused execution**: Work through your day using focus mode for deep work sessions.
4. **Evening reflection**: Review what you completed and roll incomplete tasks forward.

This ritual—taking a few minutes each morning to plan intentionally—transforms productivity more than any feature ever could. Open Sunsama supports this ritual without requiring $20/month.

### Who It's Best For

Open Sunsama serves anyone who wants a complete **free planner app** without compromises:

- **Budget-conscious professionals** who refuse to pay subscription fees for basic productivity
- **Privacy advocates** who want transparent, self-hostable software
- **Developers** who appreciate open source and might contribute improvements
- **Students** who need powerful tools without student budget constraints
- **Freelancers** managing multiple projects and clients

## 2. Google Calendar – Free But Limited Planning

**Price: Completely free (with Google account)**

Google Calendar is genuinely free—there's no premium tier for individual users. However, calling it a "daily planner" is generous. It's a calendar that can be used for planning, but it lacks dedicated task management features.

### What It Does Well

Google Calendar excels at what it's designed for: scheduling events and meetings. The interface is clean, mobile apps are reliable, and sharing calendars with others is seamless. If your planning needs are entirely time-based (appointments, meetings, blocks of time), Google Calendar works.

You can manually create events for tasks, effectively time blocking your day. Some users develop elaborate color-coding systems to distinguish task types. It's possible—just not particularly elegant.

### What's Missing for Daily Planning

- **No task management**: There's no task inbox, no way to organize tasks by project, no subtasks. You're working with calendar events only.
- **No prioritization**: Everything is just an event. There's no way to mark something as high priority or must-do-today versus nice-to-have.
- **Manual time blocking**: You can create events for tasks, but there's no drag-and-drop from a task list. Every "task" requires manual event creation.
- **No focus mode**: When it's time to work, Google Calendar offers no assistance.
- **No daily planning ritual**: No guided workflow for deciding what to work on today.

### The Verdict

Google Calendar is a **free daily planner app** only in the loosest sense. It's free and it involves planning, but it lacks the features that make dedicated daily planners useful. For users with simple scheduling needs and strong self-discipline, it works. For anyone wanting structured daily planning, time blocking, or task management, it falls short.

**Best for**: Users who only need a calendar, not a planner.

## 3. Todoist – Popular But Heavily Restricted Free Tier

**Price: Free tier available | Pro: $4/month ($48/year)**

Todoist is perhaps the most popular task management app in the world, with a well-designed interface and cross-platform availability. However, its free tier is deliberately limited to push users toward premium.

### Free Tier Limitations

The free version of Todoist restricts you to:

- **5 active projects**: Most professionals need more than five projects. This limit is artificial and frustrating.
- **5 collaborators**: Can't share beyond a tiny team.
- **Basic reminders**: Location-based and other advanced reminders are premium.
- **Limited views**: Kanban boards and calendar views are restricted.
- **No calendar sync**: The free tier doesn't sync with Google Calendar or Outlook—a significant limitation for daily planning.

### Time Blocking? Not Really

Todoist doesn't support true time blocking. You can set due dates and times for tasks, but you can't drag tasks onto a calendar to schedule specific work periods. The calendar view (premium only) shows when tasks are due, not when you'll work on them. This is a fundamental gap for daily planning.

### Upgrade Pressure

Todoist's free tier feels designed to frustrate. The 5-project limit especially creates friction—you'll hit it quickly and face constant prompts to upgrade. Every feature interaction reminds you that better options exist at $4/month.

### The Verdict

Todoist is a good task manager trapped behind an aggressive freemium model. The **free task planner** experience is functional but limited. If you can live with 5 projects and no calendar integration, it works. Most users will find themselves paying within months.

**Best for**: Users with very simple task needs who don't mind limits.

## 4. TickTick – Generous Free Tier With Key Gaps

**Price: Free tier available | Premium: $35.99/year**

TickTick offers one of the more generous free tiers in productivity software, but it still withholds features critical for daily planning.

### What the Free Tier Includes

- Up to 9 lists (projects)
- Unlimited tasks within those lists
- Basic calendar view (tasks only, not synced calendars)
- Pomodoro timer
- Habit tracking (limited)
- Basic widgets

This is genuinely useful for straightforward task management. TickTick's interface is clean, the mobile apps are excellent, and basic functionality works well.

### What's Premium-Only

- **Calendar integration**: Connecting Google or Outlook calendars requires premium. This is the dealbreaker for daily planning—you can't see your meetings alongside tasks without paying.
- **Calendar view with events**: The full calendar view that shows both tasks and external events is premium.
- **Advanced Pomodoro**: Detailed focus statistics and customization.
- **More lists**: Beyond 9 lists requires premium.

### Time Blocking Limitations

TickTick's time blocking exists but is hampered in the free tier. You can assign times to tasks, but without calendar integration, you're planning blind—unable to see when meetings or other commitments block your time. This makes realistic daily planning difficult.

### The Verdict

TickTick is the best freemium option if calendar integration isn't critical for you. The free tier is genuinely useful for task management. But for comprehensive daily planning with time blocking? You'll either pay $35.99/year or choose a truly free alternative like Open Sunsama.

**Best for**: Users who primarily need task lists and don't rely on calendar-task integration.

## 5. Notion – Flexible But Requires Effort

**Price: Free for individuals | Plus: $10/month for teams**

Notion is a versatile workspace that can be configured as a daily planner, but it's not designed as one out of the box. The free tier is generous—unlimited pages and blocks for personal use—but building a daily planning system requires significant setup.

### The DIY Daily Planner

Notion's strength is flexibility. You can create:

- Task databases with custom properties
- Calendar views of those databases
- Filtered views for today's tasks
- Templates for daily planning pages

The community has created impressive daily planning templates. Some replicate Sunsama-style workflows entirely within Notion. If you enjoy building systems, Notion is a playground.

### What's Missing

- **No native calendar sync**: Notion doesn't connect to Google Calendar or Outlook. You'd need third-party tools (often paid) to bridge this gap.
- **No time blocking**: There's no timeline view for scheduling tasks to specific times. The calendar view shows dates, not time blocks.
- **No focus mode**: Distraction-free writing exists, but there's no task-specific focus mode with timers.
- **Setup required**: Unlike dedicated planners, Notion requires you to build the system yourself. This takes hours of initial setup and ongoing maintenance.
- **Complexity**: Notion can do almost anything, which means it takes discipline to keep it simple. Feature creep is real.

### The Verdict

Notion is a **free planner app** for users who enjoy building systems and don't need calendar integration or time blocking. The free tier is genuinely generous for individual use. But for daily planning specifically? Dedicated tools like Open Sunsama deliver better results with zero configuration.

**Best for**: Power users who want maximum flexibility and don't mind building their own system.

## 6. Microsoft To Do – Simple and Actually Free

**Price: Completely free (with Microsoft account)**

Microsoft To Do is one of the few genuinely free task managers from a major company. There's no premium tier, no upsells, no artificial limits. What you see is what you get.

### What It Does Well

- Clean, simple interface
- Unlimited tasks and lists
- My Day view for daily focus
- Integration with Outlook (for Microsoft users)
- Smart suggestions for daily planning
- Cross-platform availability

The "My Day" feature deserves mention—it encourages daily planning by having you select tasks each morning from your lists. This ritual mirrors more sophisticated daily planners.

### Limitations for Daily Planning

- **No calendar view**: You can't see tasks on a timeline or time block them.
- **Outlook-only calendar sync**: Works with Outlook but not Google Calendar or iCloud.
- **Basic feature set**: No subtasks with nesting, limited organization options.
- **No focus mode**: Nothing to support deep work sessions.
- **No time estimation**: Can't assign duration to tasks.

### The Verdict

Microsoft To Do is honestly good for a completely free product. If you're in the Microsoft ecosystem and need straightforward task management, it delivers without friction. For comprehensive daily planning with time blocking? It's too basic. But for simple task lists? Genuinely useful.

**Best for**: Microsoft users who want simple, no-nonsense task lists.

## 7. Any.do – Heavy Upsells Ruin the Experience

**Price: Free tier available | Premium: $5.99/month ($71.88/year)**

Any.do has an attractive interface and solid mobile apps, but the free tier experience is marred by aggressive premium upsells.

### Free Tier Limitations

- Limited lists and tasks
- No calendar sync (premium only)
- No recurring tasks (premium only)
- No color tags (premium only)
- No location reminders (premium only)
- Constant upgrade prompts

Notice a pattern? Nearly every useful feature is locked behind premium. The free tier exists to frustrate you into paying.

### The Upsell Problem

Any.do's free experience is worse than competitors because of how aggressively it pushes premium. Trying to set a recurring task? Premium popup. Want to see your calendar? Premium popup. Changing a tag color? Premium popup.

This isn't occasional prompting—it's friction by design. Using Any.do free feels like navigating a minefield of upsells.

### The Verdict

We can't recommend Any.do's free tier. The constant upgrade pressure makes the experience unpleasant, and the limitations are more severe than competitors. If you want freemium, TickTick offers more. If you want truly free, Open Sunsama offers everything. Any.do falls into an unfortunate middle ground.

**Best for**: No one, honestly. Better free options exist.

## 8. Google Tasks – Basic But Genuinely Free

**Price: Completely free (with Google account)**

Google Tasks is the most basic option on this list—a simple task list built into Gmail and Google Calendar. There's no premium tier because there's barely a product.

### What It Offers

- Simple task lists
- Due dates and times
- Subtasks (basic)
- Integration with Gmail (create tasks from emails)
- Shows in Google Calendar sidebar

### What It Lacks

Google Tasks lacks almost everything needed for daily planning:

- No calendar view
- No time blocking
- No project organization
- No labels or tags
- No priority levels
- No focus mode
- No reminders (beyond due dates)
- No collaboration

### The Verdict

Google Tasks is free but barely functional as a **free daily planner app**. It's a simple checklist—nothing more. For users who want the absolute minimum and already live in Google's ecosystem, it's there. For actual daily planning? Look elsewhere.

**Best for**: Users who only need a basic checklist within Gmail/Calendar.

## What You Miss With Freemium Limits

Let's be specific about what freemium restrictions cost you in productivity:

### No Calendar Integration = Blind Planning

Without seeing your meetings alongside tasks, you'll:
- Overcommit by scheduling tasks during busy periods
- Double-book yourself regularly
- Waste time switching between calendar and task apps
- Lose the benefits of unified time blocking

### Task Limits = Broken Workflows

When you hit project or task limits, you'll:
- Archive incomplete work to make room
- Lose context switching between artificial categories
- Spend time managing limits instead of managing work
- Eventually pay anyway after investing time in the system

### No Focus Mode = More Distractions

Without dedicated focus features, you'll:
- Context switch more frequently
- Lose time to notifications and interruptions
- Lack accountability for focused work
- Miss the psychological benefit of committing to a single task

### Constant Upgrade Prompts = Mental Overhead

Every popup, every locked feature, every "upgrade to unlock" adds friction:
- Breaks your concentration
- Creates decision fatigue
- Turns your productivity tool into a source of frustration
- Reminds you constantly that you're using an inferior version

## Why Open Sunsama is Completely Free

You might wonder: how can Open Sunsama offer a complete daily planner without charging? Here's the open-source model explained:

### No Venture Capital Pressure

Most productivity apps take VC funding, which means they must grow revenue aggressively. This pressure creates the freemium model—restrict features, push upgrades, maximize revenue per user.

Open Sunsama is community-funded. Without investor pressure to monetize, the product can prioritize user experience over revenue extraction.

### Minimal Operating Costs

Modern cloud infrastructure makes hosting affordable. Open Sunsama's efficient architecture keeps costs low:
- No expensive AI features requiring GPU compute
- Simple, focused feature set without bloat
- Optimized database queries and caching
- Community contributions reduce development costs

### The Open Source Ecosystem

Open source projects benefit from global contribution:
- Developers fix bugs and add features voluntarily
- Security researchers audit code for free
- Documentation improves through community effort
- Hosting costs are offset by sponsorships and donations

### Aligned Incentives

When the product is free, the only goal is making it useful. There's no tension between user needs and revenue goals. Features get added because they help users, not because they create upgrade pressure.

This is why Open Sunsama can offer full calendar sync, time blocking, and focus mode without payment—the business model doesn't require artificial restrictions.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the best free daily planner app?

Open Sunsama is the best free daily planner app in 2026 because it's completely free with no feature restrictions.

### Are there any daily planners that are actually free?

Yes, but they're rare. Open Sunsama, Google Calendar, Microsoft To Do, and Google Tasks are completely free with no premium tier. Most other "free" daily planners are freemium, meaning they restrict essential features to push paid upgrades.

### What's the difference between free and freemium daily planners?

Free daily planners have no paid tier—every feature is available to everyone. Freemium planners offer limited free versions designed to convert users to paid subscriptions by restricting features like calendar integration, project limits, or advanced functionality.

### Can I use a free daily planner app for time blocking?

Open Sunsama supports full time blocking in its free version—drag tasks onto your calendar to schedule specific work periods. Most freemium alternatives like Todoist and Any.do restrict time blocking or calendar integration to paid tiers.

### Is Open Sunsama really free with no catch?

Yes, Open Sunsama is genuinely free with no premium tier, no feature restrictions, and no upsells. It's open source, meaning the code is public and the project is community-supported. You can even self-host it on your own servers if you prefer.

### What free daily planner app works with Google Calendar?

Open Sunsama offers full two-way sync with Google Calendar at no cost. Google Calendar itself is free but lacks task management features. Microsoft To Do integrates with Outlook but not Google Calendar. Most freemium planners require premium for calendar integration.

### Is there a free alternative to Sunsama?

Open Sunsama is the best free alternative to Sunsama. It offers similar features—calendar sync, time blocking, focus mode, and intentional daily planning—without Sunsama's $240/year price tag. It's also open source, providing transparency that Sunsama can't match.

### Can I migrate from a paid planner to a free one?

Yes, most daily planners allow data export. Open Sunsama supports importing tasks from other systems, and since both sync with Google Calendar, your time blocks transfer automatically. Moving to a free daily planner typically takes less than an hour.

### Do free daily planners work offline?

It varies. Open Sunsama's desktop app provides offline access with sync when reconnected. Google Calendar and Microsoft To Do have offline mobile apps. Most web-based planners require an internet connection.

### What should I look for in a free daily planner app?

Look for: full calendar integration (not read-only), time blocking capability, unlimited tasks and projects, and no constant upgrade prompts. Avoid apps that restrict essential features to premium tiers—they're designed to frustrate you into paying.
