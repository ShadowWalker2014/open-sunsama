You've tried the dedicated habit trackers. You've tried the task managers. And you've probably ended up with two apps that don't talk to each other—one showing your morning meditation streak at 47 days, another with your work tasks scattered across multiple lists.

**The problem isn't the apps. It's the artificial separation between habits and tasks.**

Habits are just recurring tasks with emotional weight attached. Your daily exercise is both a habit you're building and a task you need to do today. Your weekly review is both a routine and a scheduled commitment. When you treat them as fundamentally different, you end up context-switching between apps, duplicating effort, and losing the holistic view of your day.

The best habit tracker with task management combines both in one place. You see your streaks alongside your deadlines. Your morning routine flows naturally into your work tasks. And when planning your day, you account for *everything*—not just the work items.

In this guide, we'll compare the **best apps that combine habit tracking with task management in 2026**, helping you find a single tool that handles routines, tasks, and everything in between.

## Habits vs Tasks: Why Combining Them Matters

Before diving into tools, let's clarify what we're combining and why it matters.

### What's a Habit?

A habit is a recurring behavior you want to establish or maintain. Characteristics include:

- **Recurring**: Daily, weekly, or on a specific schedule
- **Streak-based**: You care about consistency over time
- **Identity-building**: "I'm someone who exercises" rather than "I need to exercise today"
- **Often non-urgent**: No deadline forces completion

Examples: Daily meditation, drinking 8 glasses of water, reading for 30 minutes, weekly meal prep.

### What's a Task?

A task is a specific action item to complete. Characteristics include:

- **One-time or project-based**: Complete and move on
- **Deadline-driven**: Often has due dates or dependencies
- **Outcome-focused**: The result matters more than the routine
- **Variable urgency**: From "when I get to it" to "do or die"

Examples: Submit quarterly report, buy birthday gift, call the dentist, review PR #247.

### The Overlap Problem

Here's where it gets interesting: many items are *both*.

- **Weekly team meeting prep** → Recurring task that's also a professional habit
- **Daily journaling** → A habit that requires completing the task of writing
- **Exercise at 7am** → A habit you want to streak AND a task you need to time-block
- **Code review before lunch** → Both a professional routine and a daily task

When you separate habits and tasks into different apps, you face:

1. **Double entry**: Logging exercise in your habit app AND your calendar
2. **Fragmented view**: Can't see everything when planning your day
3. **Competing priorities**: Habit app says "do your routine," task app says "do urgent work"
4. **Lost context**: Why did you skip habits on Tuesday? The task app has the answer (deadline crunch)

The solution is a **habit tracker app with tasks**—one tool that handles recurring routines and one-off items in the same view.

Let's examine each option in detail.

## 1. Open Sunsama – Free Daily Planner with Recurring Tasks as Habits

**Price: Free forever | Open source | Self-hostable**

Open Sunsama is a free, open-source daily planner that treats habits and tasks as part of the same workflow. Rather than separating them into different modules, Open Sunsama uses **recurring tasks** and **time blocking** to handle both routines and one-off items in a unified daily view.

### How Open Sunsama Handles Habits

Open Sunsama doesn't have a dedicated "habit tracker" module—and that's intentional. Instead, you create recurring tasks for your habits, then time-block them into your day like any other commitment.

**Creating a Daily Habit:**
1. Create a task: "Morning meditation"
2. Set it to recur daily
3. Drag it to 7:00 AM on your calendar
4. Complete it when done

The task reappears tomorrow at 7:00 AM. Over time, your recurring tasks become your habits—visible on your calendar, accounted for in your daily planning, and completed alongside your work tasks.

### Why This Approach Works

**Unified Daily View**: When you open Open Sunsama each morning, you see *everything*—your meditation habit at 7am, your work tasks from 9-12, your exercise routine at 5pm. No switching between apps to understand your day.

**Time Blocking Prevents Conflicts**: You can't accidentally schedule a deadline meeting over your exercise habit. Both occupy real calendar time. When planning your day, you see that you have 4 hours of work time, not 8—because your habits take real time too.

**Focus Mode for Deep Habits**: Click any task (habit or otherwise) to enter focus mode. The screen shows only your current item—task name, notes, timer, and subtasks. This works for a 25-minute work session OR a 10-minute meditation session.

**No Habit Guilt Spiral**: Traditional habit trackers show broken streaks prominently. Miss one day and your 47-day streak shows "0 days." Open Sunsama treats uncompleted recurring tasks the same as any uncompleted task—roll it over, reschedule it, or skip it. No shame counter.

### Key Features for Habit + Task Users

- **Recurring tasks**: Daily, weekly, or custom recurrence patterns
- **Time blocking**: Drag habits and tasks to specific calendar times
- **Calendar sync**: See habits alongside external calendar events
- **Focus mode**: Dedicated environment for working on any item
- **Command palette (Cmd+K)**: Quick capture for new habits or tasks
- **Task rollover**: Automatically move incomplete items to today
- **Subtasks**: Break complex habits into smaller steps

### Pricing

Free. No premium tier. All features available to everyone. Open source means you can verify there are no dark patterns or future paywalls.

## 2. TickTick – The All-in-One Productivity Swiss Army Knife

**Price: Free (generous) | $2.99/month or $35.99/year (Premium)**

TickTick is the closest thing to having everything in one app. It combines a full-featured task manager with a dedicated habit tracker, Pomodoro timer, calendar views, and more—all at a remarkably affordable price.

### Habit Tracking in TickTick

TickTick's habit module is a proper habit tracker, not just recurring tasks:

- **Visual streaks**: See your current and longest streaks
- **Flexible schedules**: Daily, weekly, specific days, or X times per week
- **Statistics**: Charts showing completion rates over time
- **Integration**: Habits appear in your daily task views

### Task Management in TickTick

This is TickTick's core strength:

- **Lists and folders**: Organize tasks by project, context, or area
- **Multiple views**: List, Kanban, Timeline, and Calendar
- **Smart lists**: Custom filtered views (high priority, due this week, etc.)
- **Natural language**: "Call mom tomorrow at 3pm" creates a dated, timed task
- **Subtasks**: Unlimited nesting for complex projects

### Why TickTick Works for Habits + Tasks

**Same App, Different Modules**: Habits and tasks live in the same app but have purpose-built interfaces. Your morning routine gets streak tracking; your work projects get list management.

**Daily View Integration**: When viewing today's tasks, your habits appear alongside them. You see the complete picture of what needs doing.

**Gamification**: TickTick's achievement scores and streaks provide motivation for both habits and task completion.

### Limitations

- **Time blocking is basic**: You can view tasks on a calendar, but time blocking isn't as polished as dedicated tools
- **Overwhelming features**: So many options can lead to configuration paralysis
- **Premium for full habit features**: Some habit statistics require Premium

### Pricing

- **Free**: Most features, limited habit tracking
- **Premium**: $2.99/month or $35.99/year for full features

## 3. Habitica – Turn Your Life Into an RPG

**Price: Free (core) | $9/month (subscription)**

Habitica transforms productivity into a game. Your habits are daily quests, tasks are objectives to complete, and you earn gold and experience to level up your character. If gamification motivates you, Habitica is unmatched.

### How Habitica Works

**Habits**: Track positive or negative habits. Clicking "+" damages monsters and heals you. Clicking "-" damages you.

**Dailies**: These are your recurring habits. Miss them and you take damage. Maintain streaks for bonus rewards.

**To-Dos**: One-time tasks that reward gold and XP upon completion.

**Rewards**: Spend earned gold on custom rewards you define.

### Why Habitica Works for Habits + Tasks

**Full Gamification**: The RPG mechanics create external motivation that many struggle to generate internally. Completing tasks feels like actual progress.

**Social Accountability**: Join parties with friends. When you miss habits, your party takes damage. Social pressure adds real stakes.

**Combined System**: Habits, dailies, and to-dos exist in one game world, giving equal weight to routines and tasks.

### Limitations

- **No time blocking**: No calendar integration or schedule awareness
- **Game mechanics can backfire**: Missing habits damages your character, which can feel punishing rather than motivating
- **Not professional-looking**: May feel silly for work tasks
- **Learning curve**: The game systems take time to understand

### Pricing

- **Free**: Full core features
- **Subscriber**: $9/month for cosmetic extras and bonus features

## 4. Streaks – Apple Watch Habit Tracking Excellence

**Price: $4.99 one-time (iOS/watchOS)**

Streaks is the gold standard for Apple Watch habit tracking. If you want to complete habits from your wrist without pulling out your phone, Streaks delivers the most polished experience.

### Why Streaks Works

**Apple Watch First**: Most habit apps have Watch apps as afterthoughts. Streaks was designed for the wrist—quick completion, glanceable streaks, complications for your watch face.

**Health App Integration**: Automatically complete habits based on Apple Health data. Did you walk 10,000 steps? Habit completed without manual logging.

**Beautiful Design**: One of the best-designed iOS apps, period.

### Limitations for Task Users

**Habits Only**: Streaks has no task management whatsoever. It's purely a habit tracker.

**12 Habit Limit**: You can only track 12 habits (24 with extended grid). Not necessarily bad—forces focus—but limiting for some.

**Apple Only**: No Android, no web, no cross-platform.

### Best Used With

Pair Streaks with a task manager like Open Sunsama or Todoist. Use Streaks for pure habit tracking (especially health-related), and your task manager for everything else.

### Pricing

$4.99 one-time purchase. No subscription.

## 5. Productive – Beautiful iOS Habit Tracking

**Price: Free (limited) | $39.99/year (Premium)**

Productive is one of the most visually appealing habit apps available. If design matters to you and you're primarily on iOS, Productive offers a delightful habit tracking experience.

### Why Productive Works

**Gorgeous UI**: Satisfying animations, beautiful charts, and a thoughtful interface that makes habit tracking feel rewarding.

**Flexible Scheduling**: Morning, afternoon, evening, or custom time-based habits with smart reminders.

**Statistics**: Detailed analytics on your habit patterns, best performing days, and areas for improvement.

### Limitations for Task Users

**Minimal Task Features**: While you can add one-time tasks, the task management is extremely basic. Productive is a habit app with light task support, not a combined tool.

**iOS/macOS Only**: No Android or web version.

**Premium Required**: Many features locked behind the annual subscription.

### Pricing

- **Free**: Limited habits and features
- **Premium**: $39.99/year or $6.99/month

## 6. Todoist – Task Manager with Recurring Tasks as Habits

**Price: Free (generous) | $5/month (Pro)**

Todoist is the world's most popular task manager, and while it doesn't have dedicated habit tracking, its recurring task system serves many habit use cases.

### Habits in Todoist

**Recurring Tasks**: Create a task like "Meditate" with recurrence "every day at 7am." When you complete it, it reappears tomorrow.

**Karma System**: Todoist gamifies productivity with points, streaks, and levels. This provides some of the motivation traditional habit trackers offer.

**Natural Language**: "Exercise every Monday, Wednesday, Friday" creates a recurring task instantly.

### Why Todoist Works for Some Habit Users

**Single System**: If you're already using Todoist for tasks, adding recurring tasks for habits keeps everything in one place.

**Cross-Platform Excellence**: Todoist works everywhere—iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, Linux, web, browser extensions, and more.

**Quick Capture**: The fast input makes it easy to add tasks or habits whenever they occur to you.

### Limitations for Habit Users

**No Streak Tracking**: Todoist shows a streak for your overall usage, not per habit. You can't see your meditation streak at 47 days.

**Recurring Tasks Aren't Habits**: The UI treats "Meditate" the same as "Buy milk." No visual differentiation or habit-specific features.

**No Time Blocking**: Todoist doesn't answer "when" you'll do things—just "what" needs doing.

### Pricing

- **Free**: Most features, up to 5 projects
- **Pro**: $5/month for reminders, filters, and more

## 7. Notion – Build Your Own Habit + Task System

**Price: Free (personal) | $10/month (Plus)**

Notion lets you build exactly the system you want. Create custom habit trackers with databases, relate them to task databases, and design a unified productivity system tailored to your needs.

### How Notion Handles Habits + Tasks

**Custom Databases**: Create a "Habits" database with properties for name, frequency, last completed, streak count, etc.

**Formulas and Automations**: Calculate streaks, surface incomplete habits, and automate daily check-ins.

**Templates**: Start from community templates or build from scratch.

**Relation Properties**: Link habits to projects, goals, or task databases.

### Why Notion Works for Customization Lovers

**Infinite Flexibility**: You can build literally any system you can imagine.

**All-in-One Workspace**: Notes, docs, wikis, projects, habits, and tasks in one place.

**Community Templates**: Thousands of pre-built habit tracking templates to start from.

### Limitations

**Setup Investment**: Notion requires significant time to set up a proper habit + task system.

**Not Habit-Optimized**: You're building a habit tracker, not using one. The UX will never match dedicated apps.

**No Native Streaks**: You have to calculate streaks yourself (or use a template that does).

**Can Become Overwhelming**: The flexibility means you can over-engineer your system into unusability.

### Pricing

- **Free**: Personal use with unlimited pages
- **Plus**: $10/month for advanced features

## 8. Loop Habit Tracker – Open Source Minimalism

**Price: Free (Android only)**

Loop is a free, open-source habit tracker for Android. If you want focused habit tracking without frills, subscriptions, or data concerns, Loop delivers.

### Why Loop Works

**Truly Free**: No premium tier, no ads, no data collection. Open source and privacy-respecting.

**Detailed Statistics**: Sophisticated charts and analytics that rival paid apps.

**Flexible Scheduling**: Every day, specific days, or X times per week/month.

**Material Design**: Clean, native Android interface.

### Limitations

**Android Only**: No iOS, web, or desktop version.

**Habits Only**: Zero task management. Loop is purely a habit tracker.

**No Sync**: Data stays on your device (good for privacy, bad for multi-device).

### Best Used With

Pair Loop with a task manager like Open Sunsama. Use Loop for dedicated habit tracking on Android, and Open Sunsama for tasks and daily planning.

### Pricing

Free. Open source.

## How to Build Habits with Time Blocking

Time blocking is one of the most effective methods for habit formation. Here's why and how to do it:

### Why Time Blocking Works for Habits

**Habits Compete for Time**: Your intentions are infinite; your time is finite. "I'll exercise when I have time" means never exercising. Time blocking reserves specific hours for specific activities.

**Decision Reduction**: When 7am arrives and "Meditate" is on your calendar, you don't decide whether to meditate. The decision was made yesterday. You just follow the schedule.

**Visual Accountability**: Seeing empty time blocks where habits should be provides feedback. Skipping meditation leaves a visible gap.

**Integration with Life**: Your 6am workout must coexist with your 9am meeting and your 7pm dinner. Time blocking forces realistic planning.

### The Time-Blocked Habit Routine

Here's a practical approach using Open Sunsama:

**1. Morning Block (6-8am)**
- 6:00-6:30: Exercise
- 6:30-7:00: Shower/ready
- 7:00-7:15: Meditation
- 7:15-8:00: Breakfast + reading

**2. Work Focus (8am-12pm)**
- 8:00-8:15: Daily planning review
- 8:15-12:00: Deep work blocks with tasks

**3. Midday Reset (12-1pm)**
- Lunch + brief walk

**4. Afternoon Work (1-5pm)**
- Tasks and meetings

**5. Evening Routine (5-9pm)**
- 5:00-5:30: Shutdown ritual
- 5:30-7:00: Personal time
- 7:00-8:30: Dinner + family
- 8:30-9:00: Evening reading/journaling

Every habit has a time. Every task competes fairly with every habit. The calendar becomes your single source of truth.

## Combining Habits and Tasks Effectively

### Strategy 1: Habits as Recurring Tasks

Turn every habit into a recurring task in your task manager. Pros: Single system, unified view. Cons: May lack streak tracking, habit-specific motivation.

**Best for**: Users who want simplicity and already use a task manager.

### Strategy 2: Time-Block Habits, List Tasks

Give habits dedicated calendar time blocks. Keep tasks in a list for flexible scheduling. Pros: Habits are protected, tasks stay flexible. Cons: Two mental models.

**Best for**: Users with non-negotiable daily routines plus variable workloads.

### Strategy 3: Morning Habits, Daytime Tasks

Keep habits to morning/evening routines only. Protect 6-9am and 6-9pm for routines; everything between is task territory. Pros: Clear boundaries. Cons: Limits when habits can occur.

**Best for**: Knowledge workers with meeting-heavy days.

### Strategy 4: One Tool That Does Both

Use an app that handles habits and tasks natively (TickTick) or treats recurring tasks as habits (Open Sunsama). Pros: Unified system. Cons: May compromise on specialized features.

**Best for**: Users who want the simplest possible system.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the best habit tracker with task management?

**Open Sunsama** is our top recommendation for combining habits with task management. It treats recurring tasks as habits, integrates them into a unified daily view with time blocking, and includes focus mode for both routine and one-off items—all for free. For users who want dedicated habit-tracking features (streaks, statistics), **TickTick** offers both a habit module and excellent task management at $3/month.

### Can I track habits and tasks in the same app?

Yes. **TickTick** has dedicated modules for both habits and tasks. **Open Sunsama** treats habits as recurring tasks in a unified system. **Todoist** handles habits through recurring tasks without dedicated tracking. **Notion** lets you build custom systems that handle both. Choose based on whether you want dedicated habit features or a unified task approach.

### What's the difference between a habit and a recurring task?

A habit emphasizes consistency and streaks—you care about maintaining the behavior over time. A recurring task emphasizes completion—do this task, it reappears tomorrow. In practice, many items are both: your daily exercise is a habit you're building AND a recurring task on your schedule. Apps like Open Sunsama treat them identically; apps like TickTick have separate systems for each.

### Is there a free habit tracker app with tasks?

**Open Sunsama** is completely free with recurring tasks, time blocking, and full task management. **TickTick** has a generous free tier with both habit tracking and task management (some limitations). **Habitica** offers free habit and task tracking with gamification. **Loop Habit Tracker** is free and open source for habits only (Android).

### What's the best habit tracker for Apple Watch?

**Streaks** is the gold standard for Apple Watch habit tracking. It was designed watch-first and integrates with Apple Health for automatic completion. However, Streaks has no task management—pair it with a task manager like Open Sunsama for a complete system.

### How do I build habits with time blocking?

Time blocking habits means scheduling them at specific times on your calendar. In Open Sunsama, create a recurring task (e.g., "Morning meditation") and drag it to a specific time slot (e.g., 7:00 AM). The task now occupies real calendar time, preventing conflicts and creating accountability. This approach integrates habits with the rest of your schedule rather than treating them as separate aspirations.

### Should I use separate apps for habits and tasks?

It depends on your needs. **Separate apps** let you use best-in-class tools for each (Streaks for habits, Todoist for tasks). **Combined apps** reduce context-switching and provide a unified view of your day. If your habits are health-focused and benefit from Apple Health integration, separate apps make sense. If you want to see everything in one daily planning view, combined apps like Open Sunsama or TickTick work better.

### What's the best daily planner with habit tracking?

**Open Sunsama** combines daily planning with recurring tasks that function as habits, plus time blocking and focus mode—all free. **TickTick** offers dedicated habit tracking alongside calendar views and task management for $3/month. For guided daily planning with habit-like routines, consider recurring tasks in any calendar-first planner.

### How do gamified habit trackers work?

**Habitica** turns habits into RPG game mechanics. Completing habits earns XP and gold; missing them damages your character. This creates external motivation through game rewards. **TickTick** has lighter gamification with achievement scores and streaks. Gamification works well for some users but can backfire if "failing" in the game feels punishing rather than motivating.

### Can Notion track habits and tasks?

Yes, with setup. Notion's databases can track anything, including habits. Create a "Habits" database with properties for frequency, last completed, and streak calculation formulas. Relate it to a "Tasks" database for integration. The flexibility is unlimited but requires initial configuration. For pre-built systems, search "Notion habit tracker template" for community options.

## Conclusion: Open Sunsama for Unified Habits and Tasks

The artificial separation between habits and tasks creates friction in your productivity system. You end up maintaining two apps, duplicating entries, and losing the holistic view of your day.

**Open Sunsama solves this by treating habits and tasks as part of the same daily planning workflow.** Create recurring tasks for your habits, time-block them alongside your work, and see everything in one unified view. No separate habit app. No streak anxiety. Just a clear picture of what you're doing today—routines and tasks together.

For users who want dedicated streak tracking and gamification, **TickTick** offers the best combination of habit and task features at an affordable price. Gamification lovers should try **Habitica**. Apple Watch enthusiasts can pair **Streaks** with a task manager.

But for a free, integrated approach where habits and tasks live in the same system, Open Sunsama delivers the simplest solution. Your morning meditation and your afternoon deadline both appear on your calendar. Both get time-blocked. Both get done.

Stop managing habits in one app and tasks in another. Unify your productivity system and plan your complete day in one place.
