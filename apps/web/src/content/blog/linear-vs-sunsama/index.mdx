Now let's examine what each tool actually does and when you should use them.

## What is Linear?

Linear is a modern issue tracking and project management tool built specifically for software development teams. Founded in 2019 by former Uber engineers, Linear has rapidly become the preferred issue tracker for startups and engineering teams who've grown frustrated with Jira's complexity.

### How Linear Works

Linear organizes work into a clear hierarchy: **Workspace → Teams → Projects → Issues**. Each issue has standard properties—assignee, priority, status, labels—but Linear's magic is in how it makes working with issues feel fast and frictionless.

Everything in Linear is keyboard-accessible. Press `C` to create an issue, `D` to change status, `/` to search. The interface responds instantly. There's no page reloads, no lag, no waiting. For developers accustomed to terminal workflows, Linear feels like a native extension of how they already work.

### Linear's Key Features for Engineers

**Cycles and Roadmaps**: Linear organizes work into time-boxed cycles (like sprints) while maintaining a long-term roadmap view. This bridges the gap between tactical daily work and strategic product planning.

**GitHub/GitLab Integration**: Link PRs to issues automatically. When you push a branch named `feat/LIN-123-add-auth`, Linear connects it to issue LIN-123. Merge the PR, and the issue auto-closes.

**Triage and Inbox**: New issues flow into a triage queue where leads can quickly assign priority and ownership. The inbox shows issues that need your attention without overwhelming notifications.

**Custom Views and Filters**: Build views showing exactly what you need—your issues this cycle, high-priority bugs, unassigned work. Save views for quick access.

**Keyboard-First Design**: Nearly every action has a keyboard shortcut. Power users rarely touch the mouse. Command palette (Cmd+K) gives quick access to everything.

### Linear Pricing in 2026

Linear offers a genuinely useful free tier:

**Free Plan** includes:
- Unlimited issues
- Unlimited members
- All core features
- 250MB file storage
- Basic integrations

**Standard Plan**: $8/user/month
- Unlimited everything
- Advanced integrations (Figma, Sentry, Zendesk)
- Time tracking
- Custom workflows
- Priority support

**Plus/Enterprise**: Custom pricing for larger organizations with SSO, audit logs, and advanced security.

For most engineering teams, Linear's free tier is sufficient to start, and $8/user/month is reasonable as you scale.

### What Linear Doesn't Do

Linear is exceptional at issue tracking, but it's not a personal productivity tool:

**No Daily Planning**: Linear shows what issues exist, not what you should work on today. There's no ritual for deciding your daily priorities.

**No Time Blocking**: You can't schedule issues onto your calendar or visualize how your day should flow.

**No Focus Mode**: Linear doesn't help you actually do the work—it helps you track the work.

**No Personal Task Management**: Linear is for team issues, not your personal to-dos (pick up groceries, schedule dentist, review that blog post).

This is why many engineers using Linear also need a separate daily planning tool.

## What is Sunsama?

Sunsama is a daily planner designed for knowledge workers who want to be intentional about how they spend their time. It's not an issue tracker—it's a tool for deciding "what will I accomplish today?" and then actually doing it.

### How Sunsama Works

Sunsama centers on a daily planning ritual. Each morning, you:

1. **Review your calendar**: See meetings and commitments that already claim your time
2. **Pull in tasks**: Import tasks from Linear, GitHub, Trello, Asana, or other tools
3. **Set intentions**: Consciously decide what deserves your time today
4. **Time block**: Drag tasks onto specific calendar slots
5. **Check workload**: Sunsama warns if you've overcommitted

Throughout the day, you work through your time blocks. Focus mode expands the current task to fill your screen, starts a timer, and minimizes distractions.

### Sunsama's Key Features for Developers

**Linear Integration**: Sunsama has native integration with Linear. Pull your assigned issues into your daily planning view without leaving Sunsama. When you complete a task, it can update the Linear issue.

**GitHub Integration**: Pull GitHub issues and PRs into your daily workflow. See what needs review, what's ready to merge, and plan accordingly.

**Focus Mode**: When you start working on a task, focus mode creates a distraction-free environment. Pomodoro timer support for structured work sessions.

**Calendar Sync**: Two-way sync with Google Calendar and Outlook. Your time blocks appear on your calendar, preventing others from booking over your deep work time.

**Daily Shutdown**: End-of-day ritual helps you reflect on accomplishments and roll incomplete tasks to tomorrow.

### Sunsama Pricing in 2026

Sunsama is a premium tool with premium pricing:

- **Monthly**: $25/month
- **Annual**: $20/month (billed as $240/year)
- **14-day free trial** (no credit card required)

There's no free tier. Sunsama positions itself as a professional tool for knowledge workers who value focused, intentional productivity.

### Sunsama's Limitations

**Not for Team Issue Tracking**: Sunsama is personal. You can't assign issues to teammates, track team velocity, or manage shared backlogs.

**Expensive for Developers**: At $240/year on top of your other tools, Sunsama is a significant expense—especially for individual developers or freelancers.

**Limited Customization**: As a closed-source SaaS, you can't self-host, audit the code, or extend functionality.

**No API for Automation**: Developers who want to integrate Sunsama into custom workflows have limited options.

## Linear vs Sunsama: Feature-by-Feature Breakdown

Let's compare these tools across dimensions that matter for engineering productivity.

### Issue Tracking

**Linear**: This is Linear's purpose. Robust issue tracking with cycles, roadmaps, custom workflows, and deep integrations with development tools.

**Sunsama**: Not an issue tracker. Sunsama can display issues from Linear, but it doesn't manage them. No creating issues, no team assignment, no cycle planning.

**Verdict**: Linear wins by default—Sunsama isn't designed for issue tracking.

### Daily Planning

**Linear**: No daily planning features. Linear shows what issues exist but doesn't help you decide what to work on today or schedule your time.

**Sunsama**: Core feature. Guided morning planning, time blocking, workload warnings, and daily shutdown rituals.

**Verdict**: Sunsama wins decisively—this is its entire purpose.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

**Linear**: Exceptional keyboard support. Nearly every action has a shortcut. Command palette (Cmd+K) provides quick access to everything. Developers feel at home.

**Sunsama**: Good keyboard support with shortcuts for common actions. Command palette available. Less comprehensive than Linear but functional.

**Verdict**: Linear has the edge for keyboard enthusiasts, but both are developer-friendly.

### GitHub Integration

**Linear**: Deep two-way integration. Auto-link branches and PRs, auto-close issues on merge, sync issue status with PR state. Best-in-class for developer workflows.

**Sunsama**: One-way pull of GitHub issues and PRs into daily planning. Useful for seeing what needs attention, but no deep synchronization.

**Verdict**: Linear for actual development workflow; Sunsama for personal planning visibility.

### Team Collaboration

**Linear**: Built for teams. Shared workspaces, issue assignment, team views, workload balancing, cycles, and roadmaps.

**Sunsama**: Individual only. No shared views, no team assignment, no collaboration features.

**Verdict**: Linear is the only choice for team collaboration.

### Focus and Deep Work

**Linear**: No focus features. Linear is about tracking work, not doing work.

**Sunsama**: Excellent focus mode with Pomodoro timer, distraction hiding, and task expansion. Helps you actually complete what you've planned.

**Verdict**: Sunsama wins—Linear doesn't compete in this category.

### API and Extensibility

**Linear**: GraphQL API with comprehensive access to all data. Webhooks for real-time updates. Build custom integrations and workflows.

**Sunsama**: Limited API access. You can integrate through their official integrations, but custom automation is restricted.

**Verdict**: Linear's API is significantly more powerful for developers wanting custom solutions.

## The Developer Workflow: Using Linear AND a Daily Planner

Here's the key insight: **Linear and daily planners serve different stages of the same workflow**. Comparing them directly misses the point.

### The Complete Engineering Workflow

1. **Product/Team Level (Linear)**: Issues get created, prioritized, and assigned. Cycles define what the team is working on this sprint. Roadmaps show long-term direction.

2. **Personal Planning Level (Daily Planner)**: Each morning, you pull your assigned Linear issues into your daily view. You see your meetings, estimate focus time available, and decide which issues get attention today.

3. **Execution Level (Focus Mode)**: With your day planned, you work through time blocks. Focus mode helps you actually complete the work without distractions.

4. **Completion Loop (Linear)**: Finished work flows back to Linear—issues close, PRs merge, the team has visibility into progress.

Most engineers using only Linear skip step 2—they just look at their issue list and start working on whatever seems important. This leads to:
- Context switching between many issues
- Underestimating how much is realistic for one day
- Missing the deep work time needed for complex issues
- Feeling busy but not productive

Adding intentional daily planning bridges this gap.

## Why Engineers Need BOTH Issue Tracking AND Daily Planning

### The Case for Linear

Linear excels at team coordination:
- **Shared context**: Everyone sees what's being worked on
- **History and accountability**: Issues track who did what and when
- **Integration with code**: PRs link to issues automatically
- **Async communication**: Comments and discussions live with the work
- **Prioritization at scale**: Cycles and roadmaps organize hundreds of issues

You can't run an engineering team without issue tracking. Linear (or Jira, or GitHub Issues) is non-negotiable.

### The Case for Daily Planning

Issue trackers show what work exists. Daily planners answer a different question: "What will I actually accomplish today?"

**Engineers need daily planning because:**

1. **Focus time is scarce**: With meetings, Slack, and interruptions, you might only have 4-5 hours of focus time. Planning helps you protect and use it wisely.

2. **Issues vary in size**: A "quick bug fix" might take 30 minutes; a "refactor auth module" might take 3 days. Daily planning forces you to be realistic about what fits today.

3. **Energy management matters**: Creative problem-solving requires different energy than code review. Plan deep work for your peak hours.

4. **Personal tasks exist**: Engineers have lives outside of Linear—planning helps integrate personal and professional commitments.

5. **Intentionality beats reactivity**: Without planning, you respond to whatever's loudest. With planning, you choose what's most important.

### The Friction Point: Cost

Here's the problem: If you're already paying for Linear (free or $8/user), adding Sunsama at $240/year is a significant additional expense. For a team of 10 engineers, that's $2,400/year just for daily planning—more than the Linear subscription itself.

This is where Open Sunsama enters the picture.

## Open Sunsama for Engineering Teams
