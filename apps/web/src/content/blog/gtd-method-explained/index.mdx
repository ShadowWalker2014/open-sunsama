Your brain is holding onto 50 open loops right now. That email you need to send. The project deadline approaching. The call you've been meaning to return. The birthday gift you forgot to buy. Each incomplete commitment takes up mental space, creating a constant background hum of anxiety that drains your energy and focus.

David Allen noticed this phenomenon decades ago and developed a system to fix it. His **Getting Things Done (GTD)** methodology has become the most influential productivity system of the modern era, trusted by millions of knowledge workers, executives, and creative professionals worldwide. The core promise is simple but profound: when you properly capture and organize everything demanding your attention, your mind clears—and you can focus completely on the work that matters.

In this comprehensive guide, you'll learn exactly how the GTD system works, why it's so effective, and how to implement it in your own life.

## What is the Getting Things Done Method?

The **Getting Things Done method** (often abbreviated as GTD) is a personal productivity methodology created by David Allen that provides a systematic approach for capturing, organizing, and completing tasks and commitments. Unlike [time management](/blog/what-is-time-management) systems that focus on scheduling, GTD focuses on getting things *out of your head* and into a trusted external system.

The GTD methodology rests on a key insight: your brain is excellent at having ideas, but terrible at holding onto them. When you try to remember everything you need to do, your mind keeps those items in active memory—what Allen calls "open loops"—which creates stress and reduces your ability to focus on present tasks.

GTD solves this by giving every commitment a clear next action and a trusted place in your system. When your brain knows everything is captured and will be reviewed regularly, it stops trying to remind you constantly. The result is what Allen calls "mind like water"—a state of relaxed, focused attention.

## The History of GTD and David Allen's Background

David Allen didn't develop GTD in an ivory tower. His insights came from decades of hands-on consulting work, observing how busy professionals actually manage (or fail to manage) their commitments.

Allen's early career was unconventional. He worked as a magician, waiter, karate instructor, travel agent, and landscape designer before finding his calling in management consulting. This diverse background gave him a unique perspective on productivity—he saw the same organizational challenges across wildly different fields.

In 1983, Allen began developing what would become GTD while working as a consultant for Lockheed. He noticed that his clients—smart, successful people—were constantly overwhelmed by the volume of things demanding their attention. Traditional time management focused on scheduling and prioritization, but that wasn't their real problem. Their problem was the cognitive load of keeping everything in their heads.

Allen refined his methodology over nearly two decades of consulting before publishing "Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity" in 2001. The book became an international bestseller, with a devoted following that treats GTD almost like a philosophy of life. A revised edition in 2015 updated the system for the digital age.

What makes Allen's approach distinctive is its comprehensiveness. GTD isn't just about to-do lists—it's a complete system for managing all your commitments, from small tasks to life goals. It works because it accounts for the full complexity of modern knowledge work.

## The Core Principle: Mind Like Water

The philosophical foundation of GTD is captured in a martial arts metaphor: your mind should be like water.

When you throw a pebble into a pond, the water responds proportionally—a big splash for a big rock, a small ripple for a small pebble. The water doesn't overreact or underreact. It responds appropriately, then returns to calm.

Most people's minds don't work this way. Small things create big anxiety (you forgot to send an email and now you're stressed for hours). Big things get ignored because they're overwhelming. Your responses are disproportionate because you're managing everything in your head, where items compete for attention without any organizational structure.

GTD aims to restore that water-like equilibrium. When everything has a place in your system, you can respond appropriately to each situation:

- **A two-minute task?** Do it immediately.
- **A complex project?** It has a clear next action waiting for you.
- **A someday-maybe dream?** It's captured and will be reviewed when the time is right.

The mind like water state isn't about becoming a productivity robot. It's about clearing the mental static so you can be fully present—whether you're in a meeting, with your family, or working on a creative project. When your system is handling the remembering, your mind is free for higher-level thinking.

## The 5 Steps of GTD

The GTD system explained in its simplest form is a five-step workflow. Every item that enters your life passes through these stages:

### Step 1: Capture — Get Everything Out of Your Head

The first step is to capture anything that has your attention. Not just tasks—everything. Ideas. Concerns. Commitments. Things you want to do someday. If it's taking up mental space, it needs to be externalized.

**The Capture Mindset:**

Allen calls these mental occupiers "open loops"—anything you've told yourself you should do, might do, or need to decide about. Your brain treats each one as an incomplete commitment that needs to be remembered, which is why you feel mentally cluttered even when your to-do list looks manageable.

**How to Capture Effectively:**

- **Use minimal capture tools.** You need just a few trusted places where you put incoming items: an inbox (physical or digital), a notes app, voice memos. Too many capture points and things fall through cracks.
- **Capture immediately.** The moment something crosses your mind, get it out. Waiting until later means you'll either forget it or spend energy trying to remember.
- **Don't process during capture.** This is crucial. Capture is about collecting, not organizing or deciding. Just get it down and keep going.
- **Do a complete brain dump.** When starting GTD, spend an hour writing down everything in your head. Go room by room in your house. Review your calendar. Check old emails. The initial capture can yield hundreds of items, and that's normal.

**Common Capture Points:**

- Email inbox
- Physical inbox on your desk
- Notes app on your phone
- Voice memos while driving
- Notebook you carry everywhere
- Slack messages you need to act on

The key is having a small number of trusted capture points that you review regularly. Everything you capture eventually goes into your processing workflow.

### Step 2: Clarify — Process What Each Item Means

Once items are captured, you need to clarify what they actually are. This is where most productivity systems fail—they let items pile up in an inbox without ever defining what needs to happen.

For each item you've captured, ask the GTD processing question: **"What is it, and is it actionable?"**

**If It's Not Actionable:**

- **Trash:** Delete or discard it. Much of what we capture doesn't actually need action—we just needed to get it out of our heads.
- **Reference:** It's information you might need later. File it where you can find it.
- **Someday/Maybe:** You might want to act on this eventually, but not now. This list is reviewed regularly.

**If It Is Actionable:**

- **What's the next action?** This is the single most important GTD question. Define the very next physical, visible action required to move this forward. Not "plan project launch" but "draft agenda for project kickoff meeting."
- **Can it be done in 2 minutes?** If yes, do it immediately. The overhead of tracking a tiny task exceeds the effort of just completing it.
- **Should you delegate it?** If someone else should do this, delegate it and track it in your "Waiting For" list.
- **Does it need to be scheduled?** Some actions need to happen at a specific time. Put them on your calendar.
- **Is this a project?** GTD defines a project as any outcome requiring more than one action step. If clarifying reveals multiple steps, create a project and identify just the next action.

**The Next Action Principle:**

The concept of "next action" is the secret weapon of GTD. Most task lists are full of vague items like "Mom's birthday" or "Website redesign." These aren't actionable—they're outcomes or topics. Your brain resists engaging with them because it doesn't know what "done" looks like.

A next action is the immediate physical step: "Call florist to order Mom's birthday flowers" or "Schedule meeting with designer to review homepage mockups."

When every item in your system has a clear next action, you eliminate the hidden decision-making that creates resistance. You just look at your list and do the next thing.

### Step 3: Organize — Put Things Where They Belong

After clarifying, each item goes to its appropriate place. GTD uses several lists and categories to organize commitments:

**The Core GTD Lists:**

| List | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Calendar** | Time-specific actions and events only. No tasks—just things that MUST happen at a specific time. |
| **Next Actions** | Immediate physical actions to move projects forward, organized by context. |
| **Projects** | Any outcome requiring more than one action step. |
| **Waiting For** | Things you're waiting on from others. |
| **Someday/Maybe** | Things you might want to do eventually but not now. |
| **Reference** | Information you might need but doesn't require action. |

**The Calendar Rule:**

In GTD, your calendar is sacred. Only three things go there:
1. Time-specific actions (things that must happen at a particular time)
2. Day-specific actions (things that must happen on a particular day)
3. Day-specific information (things you need to know on a particular day)

Your calendar should NOT be a wish list of tasks you hope to complete. If it can be done anytime, it goes on a Next Actions list, not your calendar. This keeps your calendar reliable—when you see something there, you know it's truly time-bound.

**Context-Based Organization:**

GTD organizes next actions by *context*—the tools, location, or circumstances required to complete them. Traditional contexts include:

- **@Computer:** Tasks requiring your computer
- **@Phone:** Calls to make
- **@Office:** Things only doable at work
- **@Home:** Things only doable at home
- **@Errands:** Things to do while out
- **@Anywhere:** Tasks you can do with just your phone

The power of contexts is matching actions to circumstances. When you have 10 minutes waiting for a meeting, you check your @Phone list. When you're at your desk with energy for deep work, you check @Computer.

Modern adaptations often simplify contexts or organize by energy level ("High Focus," "Low Focus") rather than location, since digital tools make most tasks location-independent.

### Step 4: Reflect — Review Frequently

A system only works if you trust it, and you only trust it if you review it regularly. GTD includes multiple review rhythms:

**Daily Review:**

- Check your calendar for time-specific commitments
- Review your Next Actions lists to choose what to work on
- Process your inboxes (email, notes, physical inbox) to zero

**Weekly Review:**

This is the keystone habit of GTD. The Weekly Review is a dedicated session (typically 1-2 hours) where you:

1. **Get clear:** Process all inboxes completely. Empty your head of any new items.
2. **Get current:** Review all lists. Update projects. Check what's on hold.
3. **Get creative:** Review Someday/Maybe. Think about what you want. Let new ideas emerge.

The Weekly Review is non-negotiable for GTD practitioners. Skip it for a few weeks and your system degrades. Your lists become stale, you lose trust, and items start living in your head again.

**Periodic Reviews:**

- **Monthly:** Review your projects and areas of focus
- **Quarterly/Annually:** Review your goals, vision, and life direction (GTD's "horizons of focus")

### Step 5: Engage — Do the Work

With everything captured, clarified, organized, and regularly reviewed, you're finally ready to do the work. GTD provides a framework for choosing what to do in the moment:

**The Four-Criteria Model for Choosing Actions:**

1. **Context:** What can you actually do right now given your tools and location?
2. **Time available:** How much time do you have before your next commitment?
3. **Energy available:** Are you fresh and focused, or tired and scattered?
4. **Priority:** Of the remaining options, what's most important?

Notice that priority comes last, not first. GTD recognizes that you can't always do your highest priority task—sometimes you're in the wrong place, don't have enough time, or lack the energy. By filtering first by context, time, and energy, you narrow down to realistic options, then choose the highest priority among those.

**The Threefold Model for Evaluating Work:**

At any moment, you're doing one of three types of work:

1. **Predefined work:** Tasks from your Next Actions lists
2. **Work as it appears:** Handling unexpected requests and opportunities
3. **Defining work:** Processing inboxes and clarifying new inputs

Knowing which mode you're in helps you make conscious choices about how you spend your time rather than just reacting to whatever's loudest.

## GTD's Organization System in Detail

Let's go deeper into the organizational categories that make GTD work:

### Projects

A GTD project is any outcome you're committed to that requires more than one action step. "Plan vacation" is a project. "Buy birthday gift" might be a project if it requires research, ordering, and wrapping.

Each project needs:
- **A clear outcome statement:** What does "done" look like?
- **A next action:** The very next physical step to move it forward

Projects are not action items—they're outcomes. You don't "do" a project; you do the next action associated with it until the project is complete.

Most people have 30-100 active projects when they first implement GTD. This sounds overwhelming, but it's actually liberating—those projects existed before, just not tracked. Making them explicit lets you make conscious choices about what deserves attention.

### Next Actions

The heart of your daily engagement with GTD is the Next Actions list. This contains all the immediate, physical, visible actions you've committed to, organized by context.

Key principles:
- Each action starts with a verb: Call, Email, Draft, Buy, Research, Schedule
- Each action is specific enough that you could do it immediately
- Actions are organized by context, not by project

When you complete a next action, you either close the project (if it was the last step) or define the new next action.

### Waiting For

This list tracks everything you're waiting for from others. Every time you delegate, request, or expect something from someone, it goes here with the date you initiated it.

The Waiting For list is reviewed during your Weekly Review. Items that have been waiting too long get a follow-up action.

### Someday/Maybe

Not everything actionable needs to happen now. The Someday/Maybe list captures:
- Ideas you might pursue later
- Projects you're not ready to commit to
- Things that sound interesting but aren't priorities

This list is crucial for maintaining focus. It gives good ideas a place to live without cluttering your active commitments. You review it during the Weekly Review, and items sometimes graduate to active projects when the time is right.

### Reference

Reference material is information you might need but doesn't require action. It could be:
- Notes from meetings
- Receipts
- Instruction manuals
- Research for future projects

The key is having a filing system you trust—whether physical or digital—so you can find things when needed.

## The Weekly Review: GTD's Most Important Habit

If there's one practice that makes GTD work, it's the Weekly Review. David Allen calls it the "critical success factor" for the system.

**The Weekly Review Checklist:**

**Get Clear:**
- Process all inboxes (email, physical inbox, notes)
- Empty your head of any new items
- Review recent calendar entries for follow-ups

**Get Current:**
- Review Next Actions lists—mark complete items, delete outdated ones
- Review Waiting For list—follow up on stalled items
- Review Project list—ensure each has a next action
- Review calendar for upcoming events requiring preparation

**Get Creative:**
- Review Someday/Maybe list
- Review "Areas of Focus" (your key responsibilities)
- Capture any new ideas, projects, or commitments

**Why the Weekly Review Works:**

The Weekly Review rebuilds trust in your system each week. By touching every commitment, you know nothing is falling through cracks. Your brain can relax because it's been reminded that everything is accounted for.

The review also creates a natural rhythm of reflection. You're not just executing tasks—you're regularly stepping back to ensure your actions align with your priorities.

**When to Do Your Weekly Review:**

Most GTD practitioners schedule their Weekly Review for Friday afternoon or Sunday evening. Friday lets you close out the work week with clarity. Sunday prepares you for the week ahead.

The key is consistency. Choose a time, protect it, and make it non-negotiable.

## Tools for Implementing GTD

GTD is tool-agnostic—Allen originally developed it using paper. But digital tools can make the system easier to maintain, especially for managing contexts and reviews.

### Paper-Based GTD

Some practitioners prefer analog systems:
- **Index cards:** One card per project or list, organized in a file box
- **Bullet journals:** Structured notebook systems that adapt well to GTD
- **Folders:** A tickler file system with 43 folders (31 days + 12 months)

Paper works well for people who think better without screens or who want to avoid digital distraction.

### Digital Tools

**Dedicated GTD Apps:**
- **OmniFocus** (Apple ecosystem): The gold standard for serious GTD practitioners. Built around GTD concepts with contexts, projects, and review features.
- **Things 3** (Apple): Elegant and simple, with areas, projects, and tags that map to GTD lists.
- **Todoist**: Cross-platform with labels and filters that can implement GTD contexts.

**Task + Calendar Integration:**
- **Open Sunsama** (Free, open source): Combines task management with calendar time blocking. While not a pure GTD tool, it excels at the "Engage" phase—helping you decide what to work on today and when. Drag tasks onto your [kanban board](/features/kanban) to organize projects, use the daily planning workflow to review what matters, and use [focus mode](/features/focus-mode) to concentrate on one task at a time.

**Note-Taking for Reference:**
- **Notion, Obsidian, Evernote:** Great for storing reference material and project notes.

**The Best Tool:**
The best GTD tool is the one you'll actually use consistently. A simple system you maintain beats a sophisticated system you abandon. Start simple, then add complexity only if needed.

## GTD Criticisms and Adaptations

GTD isn't perfect for everyone. Here are common criticisms and how practitioners address them:

### "It's Too Complex"

Full GTD implementation involves multiple lists, contexts, and regular reviews. For some people, this overhead exceeds the benefit.

**Adaptation:** Start with the core practices—capture everything, define next actions, do a weekly review—and add complexity only as needed. "GTD Lite" works well for many people.

### "Contexts Don't Make Sense Anymore"

When Allen developed GTD, contexts were location-based because you needed different tools in different places. With smartphones and laptops, most tasks are now @Anywhere.

**Adaptation:** Replace location contexts with energy or focus-level contexts: @HighFocus, @LowFocus, @Quick. Or organize by project rather than context.

### "It Doesn't Prioritize"

GTD captures everything equally. A major strategic project sits on the same list as "buy milk." The system doesn't inherently tell you what's most important.

**Adaptation:** Combine GTD with [prioritization](/blog/what-is-prioritization) frameworks like the [Eisenhower Matrix](/blog/eisenhower-matrix-guide) or MITs (Most Important Tasks). Use GTD for capture and organization, another system for prioritization.

### "The Weekly Review Takes Too Long"

A thorough Weekly Review can take 1-2 hours. Busy people struggle to protect that time.

**Adaptation:** Do a shorter daily review and a streamlined weekly review. Some practitioners split the Weekly Review across multiple shorter sessions.

### "It's Better for Maintenance Than Creativity"

GTD excels at managing commitments but doesn't explicitly support creative work, strategic thinking, or goal-setting.

**Adaptation:** GTD's "Horizons of Focus" framework addresses higher-level thinking, but many practitioners combine GTD with goal-setting systems like OKRs for direction and vision.

## GTD for the Modern Age

GTD was developed before smartphones, cloud computing, and the attention economy. Here's how the methodology adapts to contemporary challenges:

### Digital Overwhelm

The average knowledge worker receives 120+ emails per day and is interrupted every 3 minutes. GTD's capture and processing workflow provides a defense:

- **Batch email processing:** Instead of constant checking, process email 2-3 times daily using the GTD clarify workflow
- **Single capture point:** Have one digital inbox that aggregates all inputs
- **Two-minute rule:** Handle quick items immediately to prevent backlog

### Remote and Hybrid Work

With no clear work/home boundary, traditional contexts break down. Modern adaptations:

- **Time-based contexts:** Morning deep work, afternoon meetings, evening wind-down
- **Energy-based contexts:** Match tasks to your cognitive state
- **Mode-based contexts:** @Creation, @Communication, @Administration

### Collaboration Tools

Slack, Teams, and shared documents create continuous streams of inputs. GTD strategies:

- **Treat channels as inboxes:** Process notifications using the clarify workflow
- **Create clear commitments:** When assigning tasks in shared tools, define the next action
- **Maintain personal tracking:** Even if tasks live in team tools, keep your own Waiting For list

### Mobile-First Life

Smartphones enable capture anywhere, anytime:

- **Voice capture:** Use voice memos or transcription for on-the-go capture
- **Quick add widgets:** Most task apps support adding tasks from anywhere
- **Cloud sync:** Your system is available everywhere

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What does GTD stand for?

GTD stands for "Getting Things Done," the personal productivity methodology created by David Allen. It's also the title of his bestselling book, first published in 2001 and revised in 2015.

### What are the 5 steps of the GTD method?

The five steps are: (1) Capture—collect everything that has your attention into a trusted system; (2) Clarify—process what each item means and what action it requires; (3) Organize—put items where they belong (calendar, next actions, projects, etc.); (4) Reflect—review your system regularly, especially through the Weekly Review; (5) Engage—choose and do your work with confidence.

### Who is David Allen and why did he create GTD?

David Allen is a productivity consultant who developed GTD over decades of working with overwhelmed professionals. His key insight was that mental stress comes from keeping commitments in your head rather than in a trusted external system. GTD was designed to clear mental clutter and create "mind like water"—a state of calm, focused attention.

### What is the "two-minute rule" in GTD?

The two-minute rule states that if a task takes less than two minutes to complete, you should do it immediately rather than tracking it. The rationale is that the overhead of capturing, organizing, and reviewing a tiny task exceeds the effort of simply doing it. The two-minute threshold is approximate—some practitioners use 5 minutes.

### How is a GTD project different from a regular task?

In GTD, a project is any outcome requiring more than one action step. "Call doctor" is a task. "Get annual checkup scheduled" might be a project if it involves researching doctors, calling for availability, and blocking calendar time. Projects are outcomes, not actions—you track them separately and ensure each always has a defined next action.

### What is the GTD Weekly Review and why is it important?

The Weekly Review is a 1-2 hour session where you process all inboxes, review all lists, update projects, and reflect on priorities. It's the "critical success factor" for GTD because it rebuilds trust in your system and ensures nothing falls through cracks. Without regular Weekly Reviews, lists become stale and items migrate back into your head.

### Can GTD work with digital tools or does it require paper?

GTD works with any tool system—paper, digital, or hybrid. David Allen originally developed GTD using paper-based systems, and some practitioners still prefer analog approaches. However, digital tools like OmniFocus, Things 3, Todoist, and task managers like Open Sunsama can make GTD easier to maintain, especially for managing contexts and conducting reviews.

### How do GTD contexts work in the digital age?

Traditional GTD contexts like @Phone, @Computer, and @Office were location-based—you could only do certain tasks in certain places. With smartphones and cloud tools, most tasks are now location-independent. Modern adaptations include energy-based contexts (@HighFocus, @LowFocus), time-based contexts (Morning, Afternoon), or mode-based contexts (@Creation, @Communication). Some practitioners organize by project rather than context.

### Is GTD good for creative work or just task management?

GTD excels at managing commitments but can support creative work too. By clearing routine tasks from your mind, GTD creates mental space for creative thinking. Allen's "Horizons of Focus" framework addresses higher-level thinking from daily actions up to life purpose. However, many creative professionals combine GTD with specific creative workflows or goal-setting systems for a complete approach.

### How long does it take to implement GTD?

Initial implementation takes 2-4 hours for a complete brain dump and system setup. Learning the workflow takes a few weeks of practice. Developing the Weekly Review habit typically takes 1-2 months. Most practitioners say it takes about three months before GTD feels natural, though benefits appear much sooner.

## Conclusion

The Getting Things Done methodology has endured for over two decades because it addresses something fundamental about knowledge work: the unsustainable cognitive load of keeping everything in your head. By providing a systematic approach for capturing, clarifying, organizing, reviewing, and executing your commitments, GTD transforms overwhelm into clarity.

The key principles to remember:

1. **Your brain is for having ideas, not holding them.** Get everything into a trusted external system.

2. **Define the next action.** Vague items create resistance. Specific, physical actions create momentum.

3. **The Weekly Review is non-negotiable.** Regular review is what transforms lists into a trusted system.

4. **Mind like water is the goal.** When your system handles the remembering, your mind is free for focused attention.

5. **The tool matters less than the practice.** A simple system you use beats a complex system you abandon.

Start with a brain dump. Write down every open loop, commitment, and thing that has your attention. Then process each item: What is it? Is it actionable? What's the next action? Where does it belong?

The initial capture can be overwhelming—most people find dozens or hundreds of items living in their heads. That's normal, and it's exactly why you need a system. Once everything is externalized and organized, you'll experience the mental clarity that GTD practitioners describe. Your mind will finally be free to focus on what's in front of you.
