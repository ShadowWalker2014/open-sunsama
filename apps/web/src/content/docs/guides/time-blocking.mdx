Time blocking is one of the most effective productivity techniques, and Open Sunsama makes it easy to implement. This guide covers how to use time blocking effectively.

## What is Time Blocking?

Time blocking is the practice of scheduling specific time slots for specific tasks. Instead of working from a to-do list and switching between tasks randomly, you assign each task a dedicated time on your calendar.

**Without time blocking:**

- Work on whatever feels urgent
- Constant context switching
- Important tasks get pushed aside
- Day ends with key work incomplete

**With time blocking:**

- Each task has protected time
- Focus periods for deep work
- Clear boundaries between tasks
- Realistic view of your capacity

## Creating Time Blocks in Open Sunsama

### Method 1: Drag and Drop

1. Find a task in your day column
2. Drag it to the calendar panel on the right
3. Drop it at your desired time
4. Adjust duration by dragging the edges

### Method 2: From Task Details

1. Click a task to open its details
2. Click **Schedule Time Block**
3. Select date, start time, and end time
4. Click **Create**

### Method 3: Calendar First

1. Click an empty slot in the calendar
2. Enter a title for the time block
3. Optionally link it to an existing task

## Best Practices

### 1. Block Your Most Important Work First

Start each day by blocking time for your most important tasks. These should get your best hours.

```
9:00 - 11:00  Deep work: Project proposal (P0)
11:00 - 11:30 Email and Slack
11:30 - 12:30 Team meeting
12:30 - 13:30 Lunch
13:30 - 15:30 Deep work: Code review (P1)
15:30 - 16:00 Admin tasks
16:00 - 16:30 Day wrap-up and tomorrow planning
```

### 2. Protect Deep Work Time

For focused work, block at least 90-minute chunks. Shorter blocks fragment your attention.

**Good:**

- 2-hour deep work block
- 90-minute focused writing session

**Avoid:**

- 30-minute "try to focus" blocks
- Back-to-back 15-minute tasks

### 3. Include Buffer Time

Don't schedule back-to-back. Leave 15-30 minutes between blocks for:

- Mental transitions
- Quick responses
- Unexpected issues
- Bio breaks

### 4. Be Realistic About Meetings

If you have a 30-minute meeting at 10:00, block until at least 10:45:

- 30 min: Actual meeting
- 15 min: Notes and follow-up actions

### 5. Review and Adjust Daily

At the end of each day:

1. Look at which blocks you completed
2. Note where you went over or under time
3. Adjust tomorrow's blocks based on learnings

## Time Blocking Patterns

### The Deep Work Pattern

```
6:00 - 7:00   Morning routine
7:00 - 9:00   Deep Work Block 1 (most important task)
9:00 - 9:30   Break / Email
9:30 - 12:00  Deep Work Block 2 (second priority)
12:00 - 13:00 Lunch
13:00 - 14:30 Meetings / Collaboration
14:30 - 15:00 Admin / Email
15:00 - 16:30 Deep Work Block 3 (creative work)
16:30 - 17:00 Day wrap-up
```

### The Meeting-Heavy Day Pattern

When you have many meetings:

```
8:00 - 9:00   Deep work (protect this!)
9:00 - 12:00  Meetings
12:00 - 13:00 Lunch
13:00 - 14:00 Meeting follow-up tasks
14:00 - 16:00 Meetings
16:00 - 17:00 Quick tasks and tomorrow prep
```

### The Flexible Day Pattern

For days with variable demands:

```
Morning:     Block 2-3 hours for priority work
Midday:      Keep open for meetings/collaboration
Afternoon:   Block 1-2 hours for secondary work
End of day:  30 min for wrap-up
```

## Using Time Blocks with Tasks

### Linking Tasks to Time Blocks

When you create a time block from a task, they're automatically linked:

- Time block shows the task title
- Clicking the time block opens the task
- Completing the task doesn't delete the time block
- Time spent is tracked

### One Task per Block

For best results, each time block should focus on one task. If you have multiple small tasks:

1. Create a single "Admin Tasks" time block
2. List the tasks in the description
3. Or batch them into one task with subtasks

### Estimating Time

Use task estimates to plan blocks:

1. Set estimated time on tasks (`estimatedMins`)
2. When blocking, use the estimate as duration
3. Track actual vs estimated to improve over time

## Handling Interruptions

### Expected Interruptions

Build in buffer blocks:

- 30 min mid-morning for "catch up"
- 30 min mid-afternoon for "overflow"

### Unexpected Interruptions

When interrupted during a time block:

1. Note where you stopped
2. Handle the interruption
3. Return to the task or reschedule the remaining time

### Recurring Interruptions

If you're constantly interrupted at certain times:

1. Move deep work to less interrupted times
2. Communicate your "do not disturb" times to team
3. Use status indicators (Slack DND, calendar as "busy")

## Time Blocking with MCP

Let AI help you time block:

```
"I have 3 hours of deep work available tomorrow morning.
Schedule time blocks for my top 3 P0 tasks."

"I finished the report early. Move my next time block up
and add a 15-minute break."

"What does my schedule look like for the week? Where do
I have gaps for deep work?"
```

## Measuring Success

Track these metrics to improve your time blocking:

1. **Block completion rate**: What % of blocks did you complete?
2. **Estimate accuracy**: Actual time vs. estimated time
3. **Deep work hours**: Total focused time per day/week
4. **Task completion**: Tasks done vs. planned

Over time, you'll get better at:

- Estimating how long things take
- Knowing your productive hours
- Protecting focus time
