The Open Sunsama MCP server allows AI agents to interact with your tasks, time blocks, and calendar. This enables powerful workflows where AI assistants can help you plan your day, create tasks from conversations, and track your productivity.

## What is MCP?

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard for connecting AI assistants to external tools and data sources. It allows AI models like Claude and GPT to:

- Read your task list and schedule
- Create and update tasks
- Schedule time blocks
- Mark tasks as complete
- Help you plan and organize your work

## Why Use MCP with Open Sunsama?

Instead of manually copying task details between your AI assistant and Open Sunsama, the MCP integration allows seamless communication:

- **"What's on my schedule today?"** - AI reads your tasks and time blocks
- **"Create a task to review the Q1 report"** - AI creates the task directly
- **"Schedule 2 hours for deep work tomorrow morning"** - AI creates the time block
- **"Mark that task as complete"** - AI updates the task status
