## Your First Task

Open Sunsama organizes your work around a **daily Kanban board**. Each day is a column, and tasks flow from left to right as you work through them.

### Create a Task

1. Click the **+ Add Task** button or press `N`
2. Enter a task title (e.g., "Review quarterly report")
3. Optionally set:
   - **Priority**: P0 (critical) through P3 (low)
   - **Time estimate**: How long you expect it to take
   - **Notes**: Additional context or details
4. Press `Enter` or click **Create**

### Time Block Your Task

Time blocking turns your tasks into calendar appointments:

1. Click on a task to open its details
2. Click **Schedule Time Block** or drag the task to the calendar
3. Set the start time and duration
4. The time block appears on your calendar, linked to your task
