## High-Priority Link Recommendations

### Immediate Implementation (High SEO Impact)

These links should be added first for maximum SEO and user journey impact:

#### 1. Time Blocking Landing Page Links (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

- Link "complete guide" to /blog/complete-guide-time-blocking
- Link "getting started" to /blog/getting-started-with-time-blocking
- Link "vs to-do lists" to /blog/time-blocking-vs-todo-lists

```

**Add to `/features/time-blocking`:**

#### 4. High-Traffic Article CTAs

```markdown
Ready to try time blocking? [Open Sunsama](/register) offers free visual 
time blocking with [focus mode](/features/focus-mode). Start planning your 
day more effectively with our [free time blocking app](/free-time-blocking-app).
```

```

### Secondary Implementation (Medium Priority)

Add to each methodology guide (GTD, Pomodoro, Deep Work, etc.):
- Link to relevant "Best X Apps" article
- Link to `/register` as final CTA

#### 7. Topical Cluster Interlinks

Ensure each cluster has bidirectional links:
- Time blocking articles all link to each other
- Daily planning articles all link to each other
- Focus/deep work articles all link to each other

#### 8. Feature Page → Blog Links

Each feature page should link to 2-3 relevant blog articles:
- `/features/focus-mode` → deep work guide, pomodoro guide, focus apps
- `/features/kanban` → GTD guide, task management definition
- `/features/calendar-sync` → scheduling definition, calendar comparison

## Anchor Text Best Practices

### Do's

1. **Use descriptive, keyword-rich anchor text:**
   - ✅ "time blocking guide"
   - ✅ "best productivity apps for ADHD"
   - ✅ "Pomodoro technique"

2. **Match user intent:**
   - ✅ "learn how to plan your day" (educational intent)
   - ✅ "compare Motion vs Sunsama" (comparison intent)
   - ✅ "try free time blocking" (action intent)

3. **Vary anchor text for the same target:**
   - ✅ "time blocking", "visual time blocking", "time blocking method"

4. **Use natural language:**
   - ✅ "In our complete guide to time blocking..."
   - ✅ "Learn more about the Pomodoro technique..."

### Don'ts

1. **Avoid generic anchors:**
   - ❌ "click here"
   - ❌ "read more"
   - ❌ "this article"

2. **Avoid over-optimization:**
   - ❌ Using exact-match keyword every time
   - ❌ "best free time blocking app" repeated 10 times

3. **Avoid misleading anchors:**
   - ❌ Anchor text that doesn't match destination content

### Anchor Text Distribution

For any given target page, aim for:
- 40% - Exact/partial match keywords
- 30% - Branded/natural phrases
- 20% - Descriptive phrases
- 10% - Generic (if necessary)
